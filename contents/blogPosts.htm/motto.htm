                <h1>My Motto in Life</h1>
                <h2>August 20, 2019 by Ivan Chan</h2>
                <img class="taiwanFlag" src="../../images/taiwanFlag.jpg">
                    <p style="text-align: right";>Photo retrieved from https://enewspaper.latimes.com</p>

                    <p><b>I didn't  have a moto until 2nd Year in university</b> because I didn't care, my mentality was <i>"just be successful"</i> for most of my life.</p> 

                    <p><i>"Just be successful"</i> was a dangerous statement to me because there are two outcomes:</p> 

                    <ul>

                        <li><b>I succeeded</b> - I lowkey develop pride and become boastful.</li> 

                        <li><b>I failed</b> - I enter a viscous cycle of self-hatred and depression.</li> 

                    </ul> 

                    <p>University was challenging because I had <b>MULTIPLE</b> failures. I am not talking primarily about academics, I am emcompassing my social, health, and financial goals. I realized <b>I need a quote I can refer to when I am successful and when I fail.</b></p> 

                    <p>One day, I was reading an article on recent Chinese history. I stumbled upon a lyric from the <i>National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China</i> (中華民國國旗歌). In Chinese, it reads:</p>

                    <blockquote style="font-size: 20px";><b>毋自暴自棄、毋故步自封</b></blockquote>

                    <p>When translated to English, it is:</p> 

                    <blockquote><b>Never abandon in desperation, never be complacent with achievement</b></blockquote>

                    <p>Here is a quick history crash course on the <i>National Flag Anthem</i>:</p>

                    <p>The <i>National Flag Anthem</i> is played when the <b>Flag of the Republic of China</b> (the flag in the photo above) is raised and lowered.</p>

                    <p>The <b>Republic of China</b> ruled Mainland China from 1912 to 1949 before <b>retreating to Taiwan in 1950</b>. Since 1950, Republic of China is commonly referred to as <b>"Taiwan"</b></p>

                    <p>When the <i>National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China</i> was adopted by the Chinese Government in <b>1937 (民國26年)</b>, the Chinese people was suffering from intense foreign invasion at the beginning of World War II. China was almost on the brink of collapse after it lost a significant amount of land along with several major cities including its <b>former capital of Nanjing</b>. The Chinese people were screaming in agony from a great deal of <b>shame, poverty,</b> and <b>humiliation.</b> It seemed that everything is going against them.</p>

                    <p>The lyric <b>"Never abandon in desperation, never be complacent with achievement"</b> from the <i>National Flag Anthem</i> provided courage and reminded the Chinese people to persevere.</p>

                    <p>It means that when you experience despair, hopelessness, and when you feel that everything is going agaist you, keep moving on and do not abandon yourself. Conversely, when you achieved what you desired, do not act prideful and boast about yourself. <b>Rather, be humble.</b></p>

                    <p>This lyric caught my attention because it reminded me to <b>be humble</b> when I am successful and to <b>move forward</b> when I fail.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center";><b>The meaning of the lyric resonated my heart so much such that I've decided to use it as my motto.</b></p>

                <p>Here is the lyrics for the <i>National Flag Anthem</i>:</p> 
                
                <p><b>Chinese:</b></p> 
                
                <p>山川壯麗，物產豐隆，炎黃世胄，東亞稱雄</p>
                <p><b>毋自暴自棄，毋故步自封</b>，光我民族，促進大同</p>
                <p>創業維艱，緬懷諸先烈；守成不易，莫徒務近功。</p>
                <p>同心同德，貫徹始終，青天白日滿地紅。</p>
                <p>同心同德，貫徹始終，青天白日滿地紅。</p>
                
                <p><b>English:</b></p>
                <p>Magnificent mountains and rivers, (with) bountiful and diverse goods;
                <p>Descendants of Yan and Huang, to be the heroes of East Asia.
                <p><b>Never abandon in desperation, never be complacent with achievement</b>
                <p>Glorify our nation and work promoting Great Unity.
                <p>Pioneering work was full of hardships and (we should) commemorate those founders and martyrs,
                <p>Maintaining (their achievements) is not easy and never seek only for instant benefit.
                <p>With one heart and one soul, carrying (these virtues) from beginning to end,
                <p>Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth.
