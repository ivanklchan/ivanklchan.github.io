                <h3 style="text-align: center";><b>Congratulations</b> Class of 2022 MED RADS!!</h3>
                
                <p>I am the <b>VP Academic</b> of the <b>Medical Radiation Sciences Student Society (MRSSS)</b> for the 2019/2020 school year. In this blog, I will be writing about general tips for everyone and my experiences in 2nd Year Radiography.</p> 
                
<!--                <p><b>Sydney Ung</b> is the <b>President of MRSSS</b>, she has offered to share her experience in 2nd Year Ultrasound.</p>-->
                
                <p>You have successfully completed first year and will continue your voyage into second year. This year will be exciting because <b>you will dive into your specializations and learn hands-on skills to become a Radiographer/Sonographer.</b> IAHS will become your 2nd Home-Sweet-Home because all MEDRADSC courses are held there!!</p>
                
                <p>No voyage is smooth-sailing. Undoubtedly 2nd Year will *more or less* bend you in some way. I will discuss some general topics on 2nd Year, I hope you find them helpful:</p>

                </ul>
                
                <h3 id="transition">Transition from 1st Year to 2nd Year</h3> 
                
                <p>We often discuss about the "high school to 1st year transition", but I think the transitioning from 1st year to 2nd year is just as important because the change can be dynamic.</p>
                
                <p>In Medical Radiation Sciences, I think the transitioning from 1st to 2nd year is more obvious because of our program's nature. What I mean is that the "structure" of the program turns from <b>"theory-based" to "application-based"</b>, I will explain that more in detail later. Additionally, a lot more <b>independence</b>, <b>rigor</b>, and <b>punctuality</b> are expected from you.</p>
                
                <p>In 1st year, your courses aren't really related to one another. You can do poorly in Biology BIOLOGY 1A03 but excel in Anatomy KINESIOL 1Y03. However, almost all MEDRADSC courses in 2nd Year are somewhat related and applicable to each other. For example, the lecture you just had on Physics will be applied to Skills Course right away. This means that you need to understand a broad spectrum of topics from your specialization to perform at an acceptable standard.</p>
                
                <p>As I said earlier, the program turns from "theory-based" to "application-based" in 2nd Year. While the "theory" component is still present in 2nd Year, applying the theory when you perform your radiographic or sonographic procedure in Skills Courses is more important than just memorizing facts. At least for me, the switch form theory to application was daunting at first. I realized that I knew my theory well <strong>but I couldn't APPLY</strong> it.</p> 
                
                <p>I don't mean to scare anyone from what I said above. :( <b>RATHER</b>, use this opportunity to sharpen and improve your learning style. I found out that <b>creating my own application questions on lecture notes</b> helped me endure the rigorous learning in 2nd year.</p>
            
                <p>You may be tempted to skip classes in 1st Year because <i>"the class is too early"</i> or you <i>"just don't want to go"</i>. I'd STRONGLY advise you NOT to skip any classes in 2nd Year because of a few reasons.</p>
                
                <p>First, Professors know who is skipping because the class sizes are small. Secondly, as I said before, skipping one course will hinder your learning in another course because all MEDRADSC courses are somewhat related to each other. Finally, you will have labs that begin at 8:30 AM that you MUST attend and MUST be on time. I'd recommend start waking up earlier to adjust to the schedule.</p> 
                
                <h3 id="skills">Skills Courses</h3>
                
                <p>Although Radiography and Ultrasound have their own Skills Courses, the structure of these coureses in both specializations remain the same at its core. These courses rely heavily on application.</p> 
                
                <p>I consider these courses the <b>"back-bone"</b> of the program because in these courses you will learn the skills to perform a radiographic or sonographic procedure. These courses are:</p> 
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Radiography</b></li>
                    <ol> 
                        <li>MEDRADSC 2G03: Radiographic Skills I</li>
                        <li>MEDRADSC 2H03: Radiographic Skills II</li> 
                    </ol>
                    <li><b>Ultrasound</b></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>MEDRADSC 2N03: Sonographic Skills I</li>
                        <li>MEDRADSC 2Q03: Sonographic Skills II</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Skills course has three components: Theory, Lab, and Lab Practice.</p> 
                
                <ul>
                    
                    <li><b>Theory Component</b></li> 
                    
                    <p>You learn to critique your images. <b>Critique means to assess an image for proper image acquisition technique and for any possible pathology.</b> At the end of Skills Courses, you will be able to distinguish between good and bad images, as well as pathology demonstrated in those images.</p>
                    
                    <li><b>Lab Component</b></li>
                    
                    <p>Built upon the Theory component, you will learn the skills required to perform a procedure.  You will learn to operate the equipment, to scan (ultrasound), to properly position (radiography), and to effectively communicate. You will be working in small groups with a Lab Instructor (Skills Professor), who will teach you and guide you along the way.</p>
                    
                    <p>You MUST attend the Labs with proper attire (scrubs and closed heel shoes) and be ON TIME!! You will be penalized for being late!!</p>
                    
                    <p>For Radiographers, you will start learning to perform a radiographic procedure on a finger (PA, LATERAL, OBLIQUE Finger) and gradually move on to learn all routines of the <b>Upper Extremity, Lower Extremity, Shoulder &amp; Pelvic Girdle, Abdomen, Chest, and Ribs</b> by the end of Radiographic Skills II. This will be a brand new skill for most of you so make sure to keep up with the work. You will also learn more complex anatomical terms that are built upon the terms you learned in KINESIOL 1Y03. Examples of these terms are <b>"anterioposterior (AP)"</b>, <b>"posteroanterior (PA)"</b>, and <b>"right anterior oblique" (RAO).</b></p> 
                
                    <p>Sonographers will start learning sonographic routines of Great Vessels (aorta and IVC) and eventually be able to perform <b>Abdomen, Pelvis, and Thyroid ultrasound</b> at the end of Sonographic Skills II. During your Skills Course, you will use the PACS imaging archival system to look at the images you took. These skills will be completely new to you so make sure you stay on top of your studies.</p>
                    
                    <li><b>Lab Practice</b></li> 
                    
                    <p>You sign up for Lab Practices to practice the skills you learned in lab. It is CRUCIAL that you sign up for these Lab Practice hours and use them effectively because you will be <b>tested</b> on the skills.</p> 
                    
                </ul>
                        
                <p>At the very beginning of your first Skills Course in Fall, you will get hands-on right away in communication. You will learn and practice the skills on retrieving a patient from the waiting room and get tested on it two weeks after on your "Communication Test".</p>
                
                <p>After your Communication Test, you will dive straight into radiographic/sonographic skills.</p> 
                
                <p>There will be Skills Tests for both Radiography and Sonography. You will essentially perform a radiographic or sonographic procedure on your own in these Skills Tests. The passing grade for each Skills Test is 70% and you need to achieve an average grade of 70% on all Skills Tests to pass the course. This means that you may fail one Skills Test, but you are required to pass the next Skills Test to get an average grade of 70%. To prepare for these Skills Tests, you sign up in Lab Practices outside of class time to practice with your peers. Make sure you use these Lab Practices time wisely!! Remember, to pass these Skills Tests you HAVE to practice!!</p>
                
                <p>Aside from Skills Courses, there are theory-focused courses such as physics, anatomy, pathology, and radiobiology. While these courses are "theory" in nature, they get extensively applied to Skills Courses. Which is why having a good understanding of all MEDRADSC coureses is crucial to succeed in 2nd Year.</p>
                
                <h3 id="challengingCourses">Challenging Courses</h3>
                
                <p>I've found these courses challenging in Radiography:</p> 
                
                <ul>
                    
                    <li><b>MEDRADSC 2X03 Radiobiology</b></li>
                    
                    <p>This course teaches different interactions of radiation with cellular organisms. It also emphasizes on radiation protection and the laws surrounding it. Concepts in this course are hard and it does require a considerable amount of effort to achieve full comprehension. The level of math in this course is easy, but the concepts make the math hard to grasp.  Review <b>BIOLOGY 1A03</b> because this course focuses a lot on the cell cycle.</p>
                    
                    <p>Use the study manual from the course, I found it very useful.</p>
                    
                    <li><b>MEDRADSC 2D03 &amp; 2RA3 Relational Anatomy I &amp; II</b></li>
                    
                    <p>MEDRADSC 2D03 &amp; 2RA3 emphasize on anatomical relationships between body parts with little to no focus on physiology. It emphasizes on "<i>WHERE</i> is the liver <i>IN RELATION</i> to the left kidney" <b>rather than</b> "<i>HOW</i> does the liver work."</p>
                    
                    <p>MEDRADSC 2D03 is the Fall Term course that goes into extensive detail on <b>bony anatomy</b>. You will learn very specific structures of a bone such as the <i>"intertrochanteric crest of the right femur"</i> and explore relationships between different bones. An example would be: <i>"Describe the relationship between the coronoid process and the radial tuberosity"</i>.</p> 
                    
                    <p>MEDRADSC 2RA3 is the Winter Term course that introduces relational anatomy of the <b>abdominal organs, neck structures</b>, and the <b>brain</b>. I think this course is more challenging than MEDRADSC 2D03 because their relationships, especially brain structures, are harder to "picture" in the mind. I felt overwhelmed for the first three weeks but I found it useful to use the textbook's workbook to practice for tests.</p> 
                    
                    <p>You are required to purpose an online subscription of E-anatomy. It might seem excessive but E-anatomy provides good visual aids by providing CT scans and radiographs for labelling.</p>
                    
                    <p>Aside from tests, there are <b>bell-ringers</b> in this course. They aren't hard but you really need to understand the relationships and STUDY WELL for them.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Remember, the focus of these two courses are <i>relational anatomy</i> <b>NOT</b> <i>physiology!!</i>
                    
                    <li><b>MEDRADSC 2I03 Pathology and Procedures</b></li>
                        
                    <p>This course introduces you to the many pathologies seen on radiographs and CT. While the content is not hard, it has a lot of content. You will learn various radiographic presentations and characteristics of multiple pathologies. Pathologies can be different but may appear similar on radiographs, make sure you pay attention to subtle differences in the radiographs and CT images on top of knowing the radiographic characteristics of the pathology.</p>
                    
                    <p>Aside from pathologies, this course also discusses several medical procedures to treat pathologies with radiographic guidance. These procedures are quite complex and it may take time for you to understand.</p>
                    
                </ul>
                
                <h3 id="thingsToBuy">Things to Buy</h3>

                </ul>
                
                <h3 id="studyTips">Studying and Time Management Tips</h3>
                
                <p>Figuring out a good studying method itself is hard, lest finding one studying method that suits everyone because we all learn differently!</p> 
                
                <p>I constantly refine and tweak my studying methods. To summarize, I use:</p> 
                
                <ul> 
                    
                    <li><b>Pomodoro Method</b>: 30 mins studying and 5 min break intervals. After a few intervals, reward yourself with a longer break to watch a TV show or with fOoD.</li>
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Active Recall</b>: summarizing notes and re-reading notes aren't effective. You need to force yourself to recall, write down, and make connections within the content to remember it well. Quizlet is a great app to practicea active recall, but do not rely on it entirely.</li> 
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Spaced-Repetition</b>: Repeat active recalling contents you are not familiar and you are familiar with. This anchors the contents you do not understand and avoids forgetting important content that know well.</li> 
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Make your own questions!!</b>: During lectures, instead of writing down everything the professor says, jot down questions you can ask yourself later. If you miss a point or two, write down the quesiton in your notes and refer to it later. Do not get stuck on getting all the information because you won't keep up with the professor's speed. <b>These questions also help with active recall later when you study!!</b></li>
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Clean your desk daily</b>: No one wants a messy workspace. Having a clean desk boosts your morale and make your day more productive. I recommend setting a reminder daily to clean your desk, preferrably at night.</li> 
                    
                </ul> 
                
                <p>Without good time management, your studying methods won't make you excel. Here are two rules that always stick to my mind:</p> 
                
                <ol> 
                
                    <li><b>Two-Minute Rule</b>: If you can do a task in two minutes, do it right away. These tasks could be small errands like washing your cup or get your laundry out from the dryer. When you get these small things done, they won't clog and bother your mind anymore.</li>

                    <li><b>Batching</b>: Do similar things at the same time. Meal-prep is a great example of "batching" because you pack lunch for a few days in advance instead of packing lunch every night. Another example would be responding to all the emails at once instead of responding to only one email at a time.</li>

                <p>There are a lot more I can discuss about but it would make the blog post too long. I'll leave some online resources that I found useful in time management, studying, and productivity:</p>

                    <p><b>Ali Abdaal</b> is a junior doctor working in the UK. He has a YouTube Channel that focuses a lot on science-based studying tips and time management. I have learned so much from watching his videos ever since I discovered his channel in 2018. If you want to improve and make your studying methods more effective, I highly recommend checking out his videos.</p>

                    <p><b>Craig Jarrow</b> is a time management coach. He has several short but informative podcasts on Spotify about time management and productivity. While he does not discuss too much about studying tips, his time management tips can improve productivity in studying. I really recommend to listen his podcasts and read his articles if you feel unproductive.</p>

                <h3 id="textbooks">Textbooks</h3>
                
                <p>Textbooks are great resources when you do not understand a certain concept in class. While you are not <i>required</i> to buy them, getting your hands on a physical textbook or a PDF <b>will excel your learning.</b> These textbooks are very useful for studying for the CAMRT Licensing Exam at the end of 4th Year, so you will still be using them after 2nd Year!</p> 
                
                <p>Here are the Textbooks I used in 2nd Year:</p> 
                
                <ul> 
                    <div class="webLinks">
                    <li><b><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Bontragers-Textbook-Radiographic-Positioning-Related/dp/0323399665/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Textbook+of+Radiographic+Positioning+and+Related+Anatomy&qid=1566969531&s=books&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Bontrager's Textbook of Radiographic Positioning and Related Anatomy</a></b> by <i>John Lampignano, MEd, RT(R) (CT)</i></li> 
                    
                    <p>This textbook is a <b>MUST HAVE</b> because you will be referring to this book for proper radiographic positioning during Skills Courses. It has great visual aids on anatomy and positioning guidelines for practically every radiographic routine.</p> 
                    
                    <li><b><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Radiographic-Image-Analysis-McQuillen-Martensen/dp/0323522815/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Radiographic+Image+Analysis&qid=1566969481&s=books&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Radiographic Image Analysis</a></b> by <i>Kathy McQuillen Martensen MA RT(R)</i></li>
                    
                    <p>This textbook is very useful for image critique because it presents good and bad radiographs. It also contains extensive detail on image analysis that I found it useful to apply in Clinical Placement.</p>
                    
                    <li><b><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Sectional-Anatomy-Imaging-Professionals-Lorrie/dp/0323414877/ref=dp_ob_title_bk" target="_blank">Sectional Anatomy for Imaging Professionals</a></b> by <i>Lorrie L. Kelley MS RT(R)</i></li>
                    
                    <p>This textbook is for the <b>Relational Anatomy courses.</b> It goes into extensive detail on radiographic anatomy of body structures by presenting radiographs, CT images, MRI images, and sonograms. I found it very useful to refer to this book when I couldn't understand a concept in class. I'd also recommend getting the Workbook for this textbook because you can practice for your bell-ringers and tests!</p>
                    
                    <li><b><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Radiobiology-Radiologist-Eric-Hall-DPhil/dp/1496335414/ref=dp_ob_title_bk" target="_blank">Radiobiology for the Radiologist</a></b> by <i>Eric J. Hall DPhil DSc FACR FRCR</i></li>
                    
                    <p>This textbook helped me a lot to understand the hard concepts in <b>MEDRADSC 2X03 Radiobiology.</b> It explains challenging concepts very well by providing many diagrams with simple explanations and it is not cumbersome to read. I highly recommend getting this book if you want to do well in Radiobiology.</p>
                    
                    <li><b><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Radiologic-Science-Technologists-Physics-Protection/dp/0323353770/ref=asc_df_0323353770/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=292961595591&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4689087502322247167&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9000912&hvtargid=pla-499670704283&psc=1" target="_blank">Radiologic Science for Technologists: Physics, Biology, and Protection</a></b> by <i>Stewart C. Bushong ScD FACR FACMP</i></li>
                        
                    <p>This textbook is for <b>MEDRADSC 2Y03 Radiography Physics</b>. Some physics concepts can be hard to grasp and I found myself referring to this textbook more often than I expected. The language in this textbook isn't easy to understand because it assumes previous knowledge of physics, but it does have useful diagrams for challenging topics.</p>
                    
                    <li><b><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Comprehensive-Radiographic-Pathology-Ronald-Eisenberg/dp/032335324X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=radiography+pathology&qid=1566970769&s=books&sr=1-2" target="_blank">Comprehensive Radiographic Pathology</a></b> by <i>Ronald L. Eisenberg MD JD FACR</i></li>
                    
                    <p>This textbook is for <b>MEDRADSC 2I03 Pathology</b>. It has radiographs and CT images of all pathologies taught in the course. I refer to this textbook less than I expected but it is still a valuable resource to have when studying for the CAMRT Licensing Exam.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                </ul>
                
                <p><b>DO NOT</b> buy the textbook for <b>MEDRADSC 2BB3 Digital Informatics</b>, I don't even have the book because it is fucking useless.</p>
