                    <p style="font-size: 28px">Below are more questions about me so that you can know more :D</p>
                </section>
                <section class="introQuestions">
                    <h3>Could you tell us about yourself?</h3>
                    
                    <p>Sure! I am a 3rd Year McMaster University Medical Radiation Sciences student specializing in Radiography. I finished my first Clinical Placement in Hamilton General Hospital so I am competent in performing routine X-ray procedures. Take a look at my blog on my experienecs in Clinical Placement! As I begin 3rd Year, I plan to refine my radiographic skills and get involved in research.</p> 
                    
                    <p>I am also passionate about web design! I constantly strive to improve my technique and skills in web development.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What is Radiography?</h3>
                    
                    <p><b>Radiography</b>, commonly known as X-rays, is a medical imaging technique in which a very small dose of ionizing radiation (X-rays) is applied to the human body to produce images, called <b>radiographs</b> (x-ray images). The healthcare professional who practices radiography is called a <b>Radiographer</b>, or commonly referred to as <b>X-ray technologist</b>. Our job is to produce the best possible x-ray images for doctors to diagnose.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What made you to learn Web Design?</h3>
                    
                    <p>I always wanted to develop a new skill outside of my primary field of study, preferably a skill related to technology. I picked Web Design because I want to improve my creativity. I imagine a website as my personal "canvas" in which I have endless possibilities and full control to express myself!</p>

                    <h3>What are your hobbies and interests?</h3>
                    
                    <p><b>I like to learn!</b> I consider learning as a life-long activity because we should never stop learning. <b>I like to read as well.</b> Regardless of the genre, I think reading is a way of self-discipline and to improve my writing!</p>
                    
                    <p><b>I enjoy working out and exercise.</b> Did you know that your body releases chemicals called <i>endorphins</i> when you exercise? It is the chemical that makes you happy :D I also enjoy a good leisure game of softball.</p> 
                    
                    <p><b>I play piano and guitar casually.</b> Sometimes I play in a band and I improvise. I haven't been part of any major performance but I have played for my local church.</p> 
                    
                        
                    <h3>What made you choose Radiography?</h3>
                    
                    <p>I never considered biology in high school because I perceived memorizing “biological terms” as cumbersome. It was not until my final year in high school that I actually took biology, and to my surprise, I felt intrigued by it. Especially, the study of anatomy and physiology just drew my attention to the various radiographs and sonograms (ultrasound images) presented in the textbook.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also observed and was amazed by radiographers and sonographers (healthcare professional who performs ultrasound) gave excellent patient care to me when I had my exams done. All those factors combined above fueled my desire to become part of the healthcare team who could impact people’s lives by giving quality patient care in the field of medical imaging.</p>
                    
                    <p>I specifically chose Radiography because it allows me to specialize into many different areas such as CT, interventional, and portable radiography.</p> 
                    
                    <h3>What are the differences between a Radiographer and a Radiologist?</h3>
                    
                    <p>Radiographer and Radiologist are different jobs.</p>
                    
                    <p>A <b>Radiographer</b> is a health care professional trained in <b>performing</b> an X-ray procedure; a <b>Radiologist</b> is a <b>medical doctor</b> specializing in <b>reading</b> x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI, CT images to diagnose a patient.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since Radiographers are NOT doctors, we cannot discuss findings we see on X-rays and we cannot diagnose the patient. This is because diagnosing the patient equates to <b>practicing medicine</b>, something only medical doctors can do. Our job as Radiographers are to <b>produce</b> the best X-rays images for doctors to diagnose.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What are the differences between a Radiographer and a Nurse?</h3>
                    
                    <p>Similar to the previous question, Nurses and Radiographers are different jobs with different responsibilities. Radiographers have the title MRT(R) and Nurses have the title RN or RPN.</p>
                    
                    <p><i>For example:</i></p>
                    
                    <ul>
                    
                        <li>Nurses are allowed to administer pain-killers to a patient, Radiographers may <i>assist</i> the Nurse by sitting the patient up but <b>CANNOT</b> administer the pain medication.</li>
                    
                        <li>Radiographers are allowed to take X-rays, Nurses may <i>assist</i> the Radiographer by positioning the patient for an X-ray but <b>CANNOT</b> press the X-ray exposure button.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                        
                    <h3>What are your plans for the future?</h3>
                    <p>I anticipate to graduate and write my Licensing Exam in June 2021. After that, I plan to work as a Radiographer (X-ray Technologist) for a while.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also want to become a free-lance Web Developer and learn more about programming so I can diverse my skills</p>
                    
                    <p>I am considering to write the <b>Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT)</b> within a few years after I graduate.</p>
                    
                    <p>I wish to enter Medical School and specialize in Radiology to become a Radiologist.</p>
