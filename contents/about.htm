                    <h3>Could you tell us about yourself?</h3>
                    
                    <p>Currently I am a Third Year Radiography student in McMaster University and Mohawk College. I am compentent in performing routine x-ray procedures under supervision.</p>
                    
                    <p>I like to see myself as an alturistic and compassionate person because sometimes I don't mind sacrificing a little bit of myself to help those others in need. I can confidently say that seeing others feeling contempt from my help is what motivates me in life. Being alturistic is also the primary reason I chose to pursue a career in health care. I remember I would walk an extra mile across the hospital to deliver a warm blanket to a patient, and the smile from the patient after feeling warmth keeps me satisfied at work.</p>

                    <p>I specifically chose radiography because I am intrigued by human anatomy and pathology. Deciphering and understanding anatomy and pathology from radiographs, CT, and MRI images are intellectually challenging yet mentally stimulating to me. </p>
                    
                    <p>I like to learn new things.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Could you explain a little bit about your profession?</h3>
                    
                    <p>Radiography is a health care profession that uses x-rays to produce images of the body. Our role is to produce the best diagnostic quality radiographs for doctors to interpret and diagnose. Although x-rays is ionizing radiation, the amount of radiation used in medicine is generally well below the limit that would cause any detrimental effect to the body. However, radiographers and doctors will constantly ensure the amount of radiation used is as low as reasonably possible. Our knowledge in radiation biology will allow us to question the neccessity of x-rays in certain ambigious situations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why did you choose to learn HTML5/CSS and web design?</h3>
                    
                    <p>I always wanted to develop a skill in technology. I took a programming course in high school but never really excelled in it.</p>

                    <p>One day, my friend in engineering showed me his website. I thought to myself: <i>"Would it be nice to have my own website??".</i> So I watched tutorials online to code right away and I figured that I enjoy coding. This could my new passion outside my formal edcuation!!</p>
                        
                    <p>Just as my professor told me "<i>There are multiple ways to produce the same x-ray image, you just need to think which is the best way.</i>", I think there are many ways to achieve the same web design using HTML5/CSS, it is just up to me to figure out the best coding strategy. This mentality is what keeps me motivated in web design.</p>

                    <p>I like to see my personal website as my own canvas. A canvas with endless possibilities to journal and express myself. I believe the blogs, assignments, and projects I put on this website is a great way to record my accomplishments and my thoughts.</p> 
                    
                    <h3>What are your plans for the future?</h3>

                    <p>I have been comtemplating about becoming a Radiologist.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>But to be honest, I don't really know.</b></p> 
                    
                    <p>I want to have an open mind to embrance any learning opportunities I find. I am certainly going to work as a radiographer for a while after graduating in 2021 to gain some experience. Even though I might feel clueless right now, I believe my decisions will lead the way!!</p>
