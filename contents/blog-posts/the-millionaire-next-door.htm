            <h3>Children of Consumer Culture</h3>

            <p>We live in a consumer culture. Everyday we are bombarded constantly by advertisements to purchase the latest phone, car, andgadget. Everyday we are surrounded by a “hypebeast” mentality that makes us think purchasing luxury items is somehow a “goal” we ought to achieve. </p> 

            <p><i>The Millionaire Next Door</i> asks a simple question in the beginning of the book:<p> 

            <b>What comes to your mind when you hear the word <i>Millionaire</i>?</p>

            <p>I think most of us, or at least me, would imagine a person who is earning a six figure salary living in a grandeur house in an upscale neighbourhood. They have a collection of luxury cars, the newest smartphones, enjoy the best food, and probably have a pet too. They have a lifestyle which resembles the “American Dream”, the ideal goal that we strive for - and that is why we study so hard in school, thinking that obtaining a university degree would magically push ourselves to the “wealthy” middle-class in the future.</p> 

            <p>I used quotation marks around the word “wealthy” above because as the authors continue throughout the book, it completely changed my view on wealth.</p>

            <h3>Wealth - <i>Redefined</i></h3>

            <p>As I read more, a question popped into my head:<i> What if my neighbour next door, who is living in a small and modest house, driving a 2005 Toyota Corolla to work, is actually a millionaire?</i>. This question I asked myself immediately went in conflict with what I believed a “wealthy” person is. Think about it, <i>how could someone living in a normal neighbourhood, driving an second-handed old car, still use an iPhone 6S (at the time of this writing, the iPhone 12 just came out) a millionaire? I mean I would assume he is just like me, there is <b>no way</b> he could be a millionaire. </i></p>

            <p>Surprisingly to me, the stereotypical “rich” person that we usually think may actually be quite unwealthy. The authors first reason that assets appreciate and accumulate to become wealth. From this reasoning, they argue that houses and expensive cars are not assets because they depreciate in value. These so-called “assets” quickly become liabilities when we account for maintenance costs and loan payments. For example, a physician earns $250,000 annually, that puts him in the “rich” category, but if all his earnings are spent on expenses to maintain a high social status lifestyle with no assets on the stock market, he is unwealthy.</p>

            <p>To put it simply, wealth can be defined as the <i>amount of time you can sustain your current lifestyle should you become unemployed with no source of income.</i> This definition shocked me because Inever thought of wealth this way. Referring to the physician example I gave in the previous paragraph, if for whatever reason he loses his job, he may not be able to maintain his lifestyle for more than a year. After that, his family could be struggling to live normally, </p> 

            <p>The author interviewed many millionaires, and some of them actually earn less than $100,000 a year ($60,000 in 1996 USD). Nearly every millionaire interviewed said that the key to become wealthy is being frugal, hard work, and self-discipline.</p> 

            <h3>Three Elements to Achieve Wealth</h3>

            <p>Frugal, hard work, and self-discipline are three things that constantly intertwine each other. To be frugal, we have to put in the hard work and the self-discipline to maintain your frugality. Millionaires spend at least twice the amount of time than the average person on financial planning and they make their own financial decisions, that requires hard work and dedication. </p>

            <p>Living frugally goes against our consumer culture. It means buying things that we need, not what we want, and this allows us to evaluate our spending and to live well below our means. Think about it this way, how could a person accumulate wealth if he spends all 90% of his earnings to keep up his luxury lifestyle, leaving almost nothing left to invest? </p> 

            <p>We need self-discipline to keep our frugality and hard work in check. It allows consistency in thoughts and in actions. There is no point if we stay frugal for a month but then go with our expenses unchecked for the rest of the year. I think having self-discipline also means saying no to certain social events in life. Sure, we may have a bit of “fomo”. But I think trying to attend every social event we are invited to at the expense of potentially accumulating wealth, is unhealthy for our own financial health.</p>

            <p>I used to think that the only way to become a rich was to earn at least a six figure salary, then somehow money would magically pour into my bank account. But throughout reading this book, I’ve been proven wrong and wrong again. It is relieving that I need a huge salary to achieve financial independence, but it puts weight into my heart that there are a lot of financial habits I need to work on. Even so, I am confident that I can achieve my financial goals through frugality, hard work, and self-discipline. </p>
