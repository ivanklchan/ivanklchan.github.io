            <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
            
            <p>Radiographic machines utilize large and small FSS to optimize spatial resolution and heat dissipation. This experiment examined the relationship between FSS and the R using a star pattern test tool in two different CR systems. The distance from the outermost margin of the test tool to the regions of zero contrast were evaluated in both axes to determine the experimental FSS and R. The results were consistent with the theory that the larger nominal FSS will produce less detail than the smaller nominal FSS. The smaller FSS deviated from its nominal FSS (31.7-45.0%) more than the larger FSS (0.8-1.0%). The calculated R was relatively low for all trials (1.40-2.23 lp/mm) as a result of the large OID used. The variance noted from nominal figures likely resulted from focal spot blooming, human error related to visual acuity, and as a result of the limitations of digitization of the data by the equipment. Understanding the effect of FSS on spatial resolution can allow the technologist to optimize the use of radiographic equipment.</p>

            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            
            <p>This lab examined the relationship between FSS and limiting resolution of an x-ray machine using a star pattern test tool. An x-ray tube is comprised of a cathode and anode. The cathode releases electrons that strike and cause x-ray emission from the actual focal spot on the anode. The actual FSS and the angle of the anode determine the size of the resultant x-ray photon beam, known as the nominal FSS [1]. The line-focus principle states steeper anode angulation results in a larger actual focal spot and smaller nominal focal spot. The anode heel effect states lesser intensity of the x-ray beam at the anode side due to beam absorption by the anode material; the greater the angulation, the more severe the effect [1]. FSB is the increase in FSS due to electron repulsion when higher tube current and lower tube voltages are used [2]. Magnification is the enlargement of an image compared to its actual size and can be calculated by SID/SOD [1]. Star pattern test tools can be used to determine FSS and resolution by evaluating regions of blurring due to penumbra effects; it measures along (FSS<sub>A-C</sub>) and across (FSS<sub>U-D</sub>) the A-C axis. Penumbra is the geometric unsharpness present at the periphery of the x-ray beam, and influences the level of scatter in an image [1]. Spurious resolution is an image artifact due to negative MTF; line pairs appear to switch, with dark lines appearing light and vice versa. It is a result of edge-band distribution, a distribution in which photon concentration is highest at the outer edges of a focal spot and lowest in the centre [3]. Experimental data should show smaller focal spot sizes improve resolution.</p>
            
            <h3>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h3> 
        
            <p>This experiment was conducted in McMaster University Institute of Applied Health Sciences (IAHS) Room B114. The radiographic equipment used in this experiment was Philips DigitalDiagnost and Siemens Multix Fusion Max. A 1° star pattern test tool, Model 07-542 (Fig. 1), was taped to the x-ray tube with line pair sectors aligned parallel and perpendicular to the anode-cathode axis. A series of images were acquired with CR cassettes according to the parameters in Table 1. The WW and WL of the acquired images were adjusted so to assess them.</p>  
        
            <h3>RESULTS</h3> 

            <p>Refer to the Appendix for observations and results of all calculations.</p>
            
            <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

            <p>The information provides many insights to the functioning of x-ray machines and the impact of FSS on discernable detail. The SOD was set to exactly half of the SID, thus, a magnification of 2x is expected. Using experimental data, magnification was calculated to be 2.31x. The relationship shown in the experimental data supported the assumption that FSS<sub>A-C</sub> was closer to the nominal value than the calculated FSS<sub>U-D</sub>. Thus, all subsequent analysis focuses on the FSS<sub>A-C</sub>. When comparing the percentage change between nominal and calculated FSS, the large FSS setting was accurate, with a -0.8 to -1.0% difference. However, a much greater disparity of +31.7 to +45.0% was observed with the small FSS. Limiting resolution was calculated to be relatively low at 1.40-2.23 lp/mm, while CR systems generally have resolutions of 6 lp/mm [1]. The OID was half of the SID, causing penumbra of the remnant beam to diverge more than in a clinical setting, resulting in the low resolution [1].</p>

            <p>In the acquired images, the line pairs of the star pattern reappeared more central to the blurred regions. These were areas of spurious resolution and could not be accepted as they were an optical illusion and may not accurately reflect the object [3]. The line focus principle and the anode heel effect affect image quality. Essentially, from a bird’s eye view, the focal spot becomes smaller when moving from cathode to anode, resulting in greater spatial resolution as the exposure decreases [4]. This phenomena allows positioning of patients such that the anode heel acts as a filter; thicker anatomy can be positioned at the cathode side to ensure a more uniform exposure. However, it may also result in burnout or insufficient exposure if not taken into account [1]. The results supported the theory, as the distance to which detail was resolvable was found to be greater on the anode side versus the cathode side. The method of image acquisition can have an impact on the resolution of an acquired image. Film-screen results in a high level of spatial resolution, being superior to CR which itself is superior to DR. However, non-screen film is capable of the highest spatial resolution as it lacks blur-inducing intensifying screens used to increase signal intensity in film-screen [1].</p>

            <p>Several potential sources of error exist in the experiment. These factors were partially mitigated as multiple individuals assessed the images and lab set-up, however it was impossible to remove all human error such as slight inaccuracies when setting SID and the placement of the star pattern tool. Assessment of line pairs and image blurring were subjective and limited by the visual acuity of experimenters as well as the quality of the digital image display [5]. Furthermore, FSB may have contributed to error. At equivalent technical factors, electrons would experience a greater repulsive force at a smaller FSS due to their greater proximity [2]. This may have contributed to the greater variation in the experimental small FSS and greater size compared to the nominal FSS. Finally, sampling frequency and digitization of the images may have resulted in the loss of detail, as well as the individual variation between images [6].</p>

            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

            <p>The experiment indicated a relatively low resolution in all trials (1.40-2.23 lp/mm), potentially due to greater penumbra from the large OID. Data supported the theory that spatial resolution with a small FSS is higher than with a large FSS, and that nominal FSS is based on its length. The smaller FSS deviated from the nominal FSS more (31.7-45.0%) than the larger FSS (0.8-1.0%). The subjective assessment of images, focal spot blooming, and digitization are potential limitations in the accuracy of this experiment. Technologists should be aware of the effect of FSS on spatial resolution, and the importance of using test tools to ensure maintained image quality.</p>
