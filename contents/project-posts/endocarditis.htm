            <h1>Infective Endocarditis</h1>
            <h2>Ivan Chan, July 23 2019. Last updated Dec 23 2020.</h2>
            <p><b>DISCLAIMER: </b>All medical images and patient information in these case reviews are STRICTLY cited from medical journals. Information presented on this website do NOT represent any actual patients during my care in the hospital.</p>

            <h3>INTRODUCTION </h3>
                    
            <p>Infective endocarditis is defined as the formation of nodules or vegetations on heart valves by deposits of bacteria or fungi [1]. While infective endocarditis affects the endocardium, it typically targets the endocardium of valve leaflets and chordae tendineae, as well as bioprosthetic valves and implanted devices [2]. Infection is caused by <i>streptococci</i> and <i>staphylococci</i> bacteria group.
            </p>
            
            <p>There are three types of infective endocarditis</p> 
            
            <ol>
                
                <li><b>Subacute bacterial endocarditis</b></li>
                
                <p>Subacute bacterial endocarditis progresses slowly but it is aggressive. It is a secondary infection to a primary infection. Usually, the source of entry is not evident, but a primary infection that may cause subacute bacterial endocarditis sis oral infection [3].</p>
                
                <li><b>Acute bacterial endocarditis</b></li>
                
                <p>Acute bacterial endocarditis occurs when the body is exposed to a massive amount of virulent bacteria. In contrast to subacute bacterial endocarditis, acute bacterial endocarditis has an evident source of entry [3].</p> 
                
                <li><b>Valvular endocarditis</b></li> 
                
                <p>Valvular endocarditis happens when the heart valve is infected because of sterile equipment contamination during surgery. It affects the aortic valve more than the bicuspid valve. A prosthetic valve can also be infected as well [3].</p>
                
            </ol>
            
            <h3>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h3>
            
            <p>Bacteria from the source of infection such as from GI tract, oral cavity, or contamination during sterile procedure adheres to the heart valves by circulation. After the heart valves are exposed to bacteria, it begins to inflames and grow larger in size. As a result of heart valve vegetation, the valve malfunctions, which leads to disrupted blood flow and low cardiac output. Low cardiac output eventually cause hypoxia. The vegetation from the heart valve can also break off and cause a stroke as it get sloughed in the cranial vessels [3].</p>
            
            <h3>RISKS &amp; CLINICAL PRESENTATION</h3> 
        
            <p>Bacteremia, prosthetic valve replacement, and a weak immune system can increase the risks of developping infective endocarditis.</p> 

            <p>Patients presenting with infective endocarditis can have high fever and showing signs of hypoxia such as chest pain and clubbing of fingers. They could also have nail bed haemorrhages and lesions in palms and soles of feet. There are two types of lesions:</p>  
            
            <ol> 
                
                <li><b>Osler's nodes</b>: painful lesions.</li>
                <li><b>Janeway lesions</b>: not painful lesions.</li> 
                
            </ol> 

            <p>Other symptoms are heart murmur, anemia, nail-bed hemorrhages, and emboli [5]. Stroke emboli are caused from the vegetation breaking from the infected heart valve [2][5].</p>
        
            <h3>RADIOGRAPHIC FEATURES AND IMAGE FINDINGS</h3> 

            <h3>Plain Radiograph</h3>

            <p>Although plain chest radiographs do not show specific findings pertaining to infective endocarditis, valve destruction from infective endocarditis can manifest radiographic features of congestive heart failure and valvular regurgitations [2]. The most prominent radiographic finding is the double density sign (fig. 1).</p>
            
            <img class="doubleDensity" src="../../images/doubleDensitySign.jpg">
            <p><i>Figure 1</i>: 75 year old female patient showing the double density sign from left atrial enlargement [6].</p>

            <p>The left atrium is normally not visible in frontal chest radiographs because it is the most posterior heart chamber. With left atrial enlargement, the borders of the left atrium becomes visible through the right ventricle shadow, creating the doubel density sign [2]. On lateral chest radiographs, the enlarged left atrium can be seen compressing a barium-filled esophagus [1].</p>

            <p>Positioning depends on patient conditions. A posteroanterior (PA) projection is done when the patient is able to walk on their own, while an anteroposterior (AP) view is used if a patient reaches the diagnostic department on the stretcher. AP or PA chest is preferably done erect to demonstrate pleural effusion and pneumothorax. However, if the erect position is contraindicated in situations such as post-op, a supine AP chest is done instead [7].</p>

            <p>Definitive diagnosis of infective endocarditis is usually made by computed tomography and echocardiography. </p>

            <h3>Echocardiography</h3>

            <p>In echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography provides better image quality than transthoracic echocardiography because the transducer is closer to the heart [2].</p>

            <img  class="echoEndo" src="../../images/echoEndo.jpg">
            <p><i>Figure 2</i>: 18 year old male with large mitral valve vegetation, above sonogram demonstrates vegetation that is isoechoic to heart tissue [8].</p>

            <h3>Computed Tomography</h3>

            <p>CT with contrast is the modality of choice to visualize the heart in great detail for diagnosis. Instead of coronal, mid-sagittal, and axial views of the chest, CT heart has specific oblique views to see the structures of the heart. When assessing CT images for infective endocarditis, look for thickening of heart valves. These thickened valves appear hypodense relative to the vessel lumen (fig. 3) [9].</p>

            <img class="endoCT" src="../../images/endoCT.jpg">
            <p><i>Figure 3</i>: Cardiac computed tomographic (CT) angiography with iodinated contrast, including 4D reconstruction, in the same patient, however, shows an 11-mm vegetation on the bioprosthetic aortic valve leaflets (arrow) [10].</p>

            <p>The vegetation from the heart valve can break off and become an embolism to occlude blood flow to the brain. Fig. 4 shows another 27 year old male patient presented with cerebral infarct because of infective endocarditis embolic stroke:</p>

            <img class="endoStroke" src="../../images/endoStroke.jpg">
            <p><i>Figure 4</i>: Plain cranial CT scan showing right middle cerebral infarct with hemorrhagic conversion [11].</p>

            <p>The spleen is an organ lateral to the stomach responsible for immune functions. Patients with infective endocarditis may also have splenic pathologies such as splenic infarct and splenomegaly. Abdomen CT and ultrasound are able to demonstrate such splenic pathologies.</p>

            <p>Blood culture is a non-diagnostic imaging method to diagnose infective endocarditis.</p>

            <h3>TREATMENTS</h3>

            <p>Antibiotics are challenging due to lack of vasculature to the valve. But it is used to clear up any infection and to assess its effectiveness before considering surgery. It is even harder to treat bioprosthetic infective endocarditis using antibiotics [12]. To replace an infected bioprosthetic valve, an invasive open-heart surgery to replace the valve is the only option [13].</p>
