                <h1>Infective Endocarditis</h1>
                
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                
                <p><b>Infective endocarditis</b> refers to the formation of nodules or vegetations on heart valves by deposits of bacteria or fungi (Eisenberg, 2015). Vegetation means any abnormal growth of a body part. While infective endocarditis affects the endocardium, it typically targets the endocardium of heart vavles. Infection is usually caused by the <i>streptococci</i> and <i>staphylococci</i> bacteria group.</p>
                
                <p>Infective endocarditis is <b>universally fatal</b> is left untreated, this is because endocarditis leads to impaired cardiac function.</p>
                
                <p>There are three types of infective endocarditis</p> 
                
                <ol>
                    
                    <li><b>Subacute bacterial endocarditis</b></li>
                    
                    <p>Subacute bacterial endocarditis progresses slowly but it is aggressive. It is a secondary infection to a primary infection. Usually, the source of entry is <b>not</b> evident, but a primary infection that may cause subacute bacterial endocarditis sis oral infection.</p>
                    
                    <li><b>Acute bacterial endocarditis</b></li>
                    
                    <p>Acute bacterial endocarditis occurs when the body is exposed to a massive amount of virulent bacteria. In contrast to subacute bacterial endocarditis, acute bacterial endocarditis has a evident source of entry.</p> 
                    
                    <li><b>Valvular endocarditis</b></li> 
                    
                    <p>Valvular endocarditis happens when the heart valve is infected becaues of sterile equipment contamination during surgery. It affects the aortic valve more than the bicuspid valve. A prosthetic valve can also be infected as well.</p>
                    
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Pathogenesis &amp; Pathophysiology</h3>
                
                <p>Bacteria from the source of infection such as from GI tract, oral cavity, or contamination during sterile procedure adheres to the heart valves by circulation. After the heart valves are exposed to bacteria, it begins to inflames and grow larger in size. As a result of heart valve vegetation, the valve malfunctions, which leads to disrupted blood flow and low cardiac output. Low cardiac output eventually cause hypoxia. The vegetation from the heart valve can also break off and cause a stroke as it get sloughed in the cranial vessels.</p>
                
                <h3>Risks &amp; Patient Presentation</h3> 
            
                <p>Bacteremia, prosthetic valve replacement, and a weak immune system can increase the risks of developping infective endocarditis.</p> 

                <p>Patients presenting with infective endocarditis can have high fever and showing signs of hypoxia such as chest pain and clubbing of fingers. They could also have nail bed haemorrhages and lesions in palms and soles of feet. There are two types of lesions:</p>  
                
                <ol> 
                    
                    <li><b>Osler's nodes</b>: painful lesions.</li>
                    <li><b>Janeway lesions</b>: not painful lesions.</li> 
                    
                </ol> 
            
                <h3>Diagnostic Imaging</h3> 

                <p>Imaging modalities to diagnose infective endocarditis include ultrasound and CT.</p>
                
                <p>Specifically in ultrasound, <b>transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography</b> are used to obtain sonograms of the heart. Transthoracic ultrasound refers to the technique of aiming the transducer from the base of the sternum superiorly to the heart. However, the transthoracic method does not produce the best images due to distance from the transducer to the organ. The transesophageal method reduces the distance from transducer to heart by inserting the transducer past the oral cavity to the esophagus.</p>

                <p>Although plain chest radiographs cannot show infective endocarditis, a PA or portable AP chest view can be taken as a scout before the CT produre. This chest radiograph may demonstrate other incidental pathologies such as cardiomyopathy and pleural effusion.</p>

                <p>CT with contrast is the modality of choice to visualize the heart in great detail for diagnosis. Instead of coronal, mid-sagittal, and axial views of the chest, CT heart has specific oblique views to see the structures of the heart. When assessing CT images for infective endocarditis, look for thickening of heartvalves. These thickened valves appear hypodense relative to the vessel lumen.</p>

                <p>The spleen is an organ lateral to the stomach responsible for immune functions. Patients with infective endocarditis may also have splenic pathologies such as splenic infarct and splenomegaly. Abdomen CT and ultrasound are able to demonstrate such splenic pathologies.</p>

                <p>Blood culture is a non-diagnostic imaging method to diagnose infective endocarditis.</p>

                <h3>Treatments</h3>

                <p>Antibiotics are challenging due to <b>lack of vasculature</b> to the valve. But it is used to clear up any infection and to assess its effectiveness before considering surgery. It is even harder to treat bioprosthetic infective endocarditis using antibiotics.</p>

                <p>To replace an infected bioprosthetic valve, and invasive open-heart surgery is the only option.</p>
