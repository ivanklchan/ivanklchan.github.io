    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    
    <p>Abscess is a localized pocket of purulent exudate or pus in a solid tissue [1]. Purulent exudate refers to the thick and yellow-green fluid that contains leukocytes and cell debris. When the immune system is triggered at the site of injury, immune cells leaks out of blood vessels via vasodilation to secrete enzymes to kill invading bacteria. This creates a dead pool of cell debris and the process is called suppurative inflammation [2].</p>
    
    <p>An abdominal abscess is an abscess in the abdominal cavity. Usually, abdominal abscess is a secondary illness that develops anatomically close to its primary illness [2]. For example:</p> 
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>Perforated appendix ‚Üí periappendiceal abscess</li>
        <li>Severe pancreatitis ‚Üí lesser sac abscess</li>
        <li>Small bowel perforation ‚Üí abscess develops anywhere from ligament of Treitz to ileum</li> 
        
    </ul>
    
    <h3>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</h3>

    <p>As mentioned above, abscesses are localized collections of pus. Specifically in the abdominal cavity, this abscess is confined in the peritoneal cavity by inflammatory barriers such as omentum, inflammatory adhesions, or contiguous viscera [3].</p>

    <p>Aeroic and anaerobic bacteria from the GI tract stimulates an influx of acute inflammatory response cells.  When this happens, the omentum and viscera localizes the site of infection by producing a phlegmon. Granulocytes activity are consequently impaired due to the hypoxic nature of the area. This inflammatory process often creates a hypertonic environment that causes the abscess to expand in response to osmotic forces. bacteria enters the bloodstream to cause bacteremia. If untreated, the inflammatory process develops into bacteremia, which progresses to generalized septic shock [3][4].</p>
    
    <h3>ETIOLOGY</h3>

    <p>Most common causes of abdominal abscess causes involves inflammatory bowel diseases and bowel perforation (fig 1). Examples of such pathologies are gastric ulcer perforation, perforated appendicitis, ischaemic bowel disease, pancreatic necrosis, or gangrenous cholecystitis. Trauma, volvulus, and intussusception can cause abdominal abscess as well [4]</p>
    
    <h3>SYMPTOMS AND CLINICAL PRESENTATION</h3>
    
    <p>Abdominal abscess can highly vary in clinical presentation.</p>

    <p>Patients with primary abdominal illness generally present with persistent abdominal pain, tenderness, fever, persistent tachycardia, bowel obstruction, leukocytosis, or bacteriemia [4].</p>

    <p>Unexplained pulmonary manifestations such as pleural effusion, atelectasis, or pneumonia may result from subphrenic abdominal abscess. Shoulder pain and hiccups are also indications of subphrenic abdominal abscess. Patients with pelvic abscesses may present with polyuria, diarrhea, or tenesmus. Acute diverticulitis can present with pericolonic or pelvic abscess as well [4][5].</p>

    <p>Septic shock is a common symptom presented with suffer dehydration, high cardiac output, tachycardia, and oliguira. Respiratory alkalosis occur initially from hyperventilation. If left untreated, acidosis occurs with multiple organ failure [4].</p>
    
    <h3>RADIOGRAPHIC APPEARANCE</h3> 
    
    <h3>Plain Radiograph</h3>

    <p>Due to similar differential attenuation of abscess and surrounding anatomy, and contrast resolution limitations, abdominal abscesses do not appear on plain abdominal radiographs [6][7]. However, plain abdominal x-rays can demonstrates findings of the predisposing illness or features resulting from abdominal abscess such as pulmonary manifestations [4].</p>

    <img src="/ivanklchan.github.io/images/bowelPerf.jpg" class="bowelPerf">
    <p><i>Figure 1.</i> Frontal abdomen radiograph showing bowel perforation [8]</p>

    <p>The above abdominal radiograph demonstrates crescentic gas under the right hemidiaphragm [8]. It is unclear if this patient had abdominal abscess related to bowel perferation, CT must be done to role out the presence of of an abscess. Patient must be in erect position to show subphrenic free air [10]. </p>

    <p>To obtain an anteroposterior (AP) abdomen projection, select a 35 cm x 17 cm iamge receptor.  Centre 2" above the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and open collimation to include inferior margins of lung field. Use technical factors of 80 kVp and 20 mAs [11]. </p>

    <h3>CT</h3>

    <p>CT is the preferred modality to image abscess because of its contrast resolution superiority over plain radiography. Difference in Housefield units between abscess and normal mesenteric fat is great enough to be visualized in CT [6]. Figure 2 shows characteristic CT patterns for abscess. </p>

    <img src="/ivanklchan.github.io/images/absPatt.PNG" class="absPatt">

    <p><i>Figure 2.</i> Characteristic CT patterns for abdominal abscess</p>

    <p>A list of characteristic findings are summarized below:</p>

    <ul> 
        
        <li><b>Enhanced ring</b>: Vasculature around the abscess sac taking up CT contrast.</li>
        
        <li><b>Locualted gass patterns within abscess sac</b>: Bacteria inside the abscess metabolize and release gas.</li>
        
        <li><b>Abnormal hyperdense region</b>: Region around the bowel should appear hypodense because mesentary is fatty. Any hyperdense region near the bowel region indicates abdnormalities.</li>
        
        <li><b>Absence bowel wall pattern</b>: Bowel wall pattern are visualized on normal bowel. Since Abscesses are not bowel, they do not have the bowel wall pattern.</li>
    
    </ul>

    <p>In a case of a morbidly obese female patient presented with increasing right upper quadrant abdominal pain for one week duration, a CT abdomen exam  revealed a right subhepatic abscess measuring 13 cm in diameter (fig. 3) [11]. Note the enhanced ring, abscence bowel wall pattern,  and the abnormal hyperdense characteristics of abdominal abscess. The thickness of the patient has caused pronouced streaking artifacts. </p>
    
    <p>While specific scan protocol varies across different institutions and manufacturers, CT abdomen protocols are done in inspiration, helical, and a pitch of less than 1 is used to increase spatial resolution. Scan field of view (SFOV) starts at 1 cm superior to diaphragm and ends at lesser trochanters of femur. Images are acquried in craniocadual direction [12].</p>

    <h3>Ultrasound</h3>

    <p>If the use of CT is contraindicated because of patient condition, bedside ultrasound to detect abscesses can be considered. Ultrasound also provides quick diagnosis when patients are presented to the emergency department. Start with a linear transducer set at a frequency between 5.0 and 7.5 MHz. If a deeper abscess is suspected, switch to a curvilinear probe set at 3.5 MHz to allow deeper penetration of soundwaves [13]. </p>

    <p>Sonographically, abscesses appear as oval, hypoechoic spherical mass of fluid with poorly defined borders (fig. 4). Septae, sediment, or gas can be present within the abscess [13]. </p>

    <p><i>Figure 4.</i> Typical appearance of a spherical abscess [13]</p>

    <h3>TREATMENT</h3>

    <p>Image-guided percantaneous abscess drainage is the most common procedure performed to treat abdominal abscess. CT is preferred modality for image guidance because small, deep fluid collections that are close to vital organs can be visualized [14]. Ultrasound is usually immediately available and provides excellent visualization of larger and more superficial abscesses. Sonography also provides the best visualization of direct needle advancement, septations, loculations, adjacent vascular structures, and many pelvic fluid collections [14]. However, ultrasound cannot penetrate extensive structures and air-filled structures such as bowel loops.</p>
    
    <p>The mortality rate of abdominal abscess has decreased signifantly due to improvements in image-guided abscess drainage. Surgery is an treatment option reserved for failure to control sepsis after percutaneous abscess [14]. Because risks of percutaneous drainage include infection, sepsis, oversedation, and bleeding, active monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation is required [14] </p>

    <p>The morbidly obese patient shown in figure. 4 underwent a percutaneous abscess drainge (fig. 5) using CT-guidance in interventional radiology [11].</p>
