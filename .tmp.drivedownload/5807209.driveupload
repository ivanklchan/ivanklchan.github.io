    &lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Urolithiasis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;urinary calculi&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;renal calculi&lt;/em&gt;, are all interchangeable terms that referes to the presence of stones anywhere along the course of the urinary system (Jones, n.d). &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kidney stones are found most commonly in individuals between the ages of 30 to 60. It is estimated that 5% of women and 12% of men will develop kidney stones in their life time (Young VB, Kormos WA, Chick DA et-al. Blueprints Medicine). &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Renal calculi are most commonly composed of calcium salts. Examples of stone composition are:
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Calcium oxalate: the most common form of kidney stones&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Calcium phosphate&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Uric acid&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Cystine&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Struvite&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Etiology&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Causes of renal calculi can be divided into three categories: 

        &lt;ol&gt; 
            &lt;li&gt;Metabolic (Eisenberg &amp; Johnson, 2015)
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hyperparathyroidism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Disorders in the parathyroid glands, which are the four glands located at the posterior portion of the neck which regulates calcium levels in the blood, can cause hypercalcaemia.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Increased calcium intake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Increasing calcium intake in diet can cause hypercalcaemia, which would predispose the individual to develop calcium salt stones in the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Genetic
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Familial hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A rare genetic disorder of low blood magnesium with high calcium in urine calcium in kidney can predispose infans and children to form kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the research by Edvardsson et al (2013), the deficiency of this adenine phosphoribosyltransferase has been linked to the formation of kidney stones. However, the pathway and mechanism of how the deficiency of this enzyme causes renal calculi is beyond the scope of this case review. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Other
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urinary Stasis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Urinary stasis from immobility can lead to chemical changes in urine, leading to kidney stones formation (Eisenberg &amp; Johnson, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urinary Tract Infection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;UTI can cause struvite stones because of an enzyme that is released by certain types of bacteria. Women are more likely to develop struvite stones because they have a higher chance of developing UTIs (Sepsis Alliance, 2020). &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;High intake of lithogenic substances such as oxalic acid, uric acid, and calcium can increase the concentration of these chemicals in blood and urine, predisposing the individual to form kidney stones. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Chemistry&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Although the chemistry of kidney stones formation maybe beyond the knowledge of imaging professionals, it is important to understand the basic chemical processes of renal calculi in order to appreciate their image appearances (Chibba, 2020).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Let's consider the chemical equilirbium of calcium oxalate:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;chemistry-reaction&quot;&gt;CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ‚áå &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;i&gt;aq&lt;/i&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2‚àí&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;i&gt;aq&lt;/i&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp = &amp;nbsp 2.7 √ó 10&lt;sup&gt;‚àí9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;solubility product constant&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; describes the solubility of a substance in water and it ranges from 0 onwards. The larger the &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the more solubale the substance is. Conversely, the closer the &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is to 0, the less soluble the substance is. For example, table salt NaCl has a &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of 37.66. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Because the &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of calcium oxalate is very small at 2.7 √ó 10&lt;sup&gt;‚àí9&lt;/sup&gt;, it is &lt;em&gt;sparingly&lt;/em&gt; soluble in water. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Applying this concept to renal calculi, this means that only a very small amount of calcium oxalate is needed to reach the solubility threshold in kidneys. Thus, if the solubility threshold is passed, the chemical equilibrium would shift to the &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt;, and any extra oxalate anions would immediately form an ionic bond with any calcium cations floating in the urine to precipate into solid calcium oxalate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As calcium oxalate precipates, these precipates would aggregate together and grow larger in size. Eventually they become big enough to obstruct urine flow at the UP junction or at the ureter, causing extreme flank pain. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Clinical Presentation&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The patient could be asymptomatic if the renal calculi is not obstructing the urinary tract. However, if the calculus is obstructing the urinary pathway, it could cause severe lower back flank pain. The patient could also present with hematuria resulting from the edges of the stone scrapping the inner wall of the ureter (Eisenberg &amp; Johnson, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Blood work may also indicate hypercalcaemia because of the relationship between high calcium intake and stones formation. Patients may also experience strangury, which is a symptom characterized by painful, frequent urination of small volumes that are expelled slowly only by straining and despite a severe sense of urgency, usually with the residual feeling of incomplete emptying (Eisenberg &amp; Johnson, 2015). &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Other pathologies secondary to renal calculi may be detectable on diagnostic imaging. The most notable one being hydronephrosis, which is the dilation of the renal calyces caused by a calculus obstructing the ureter (CT scan). Urinary tract infection may also be present as urine cannot be adequately drained outside of the body, causing stasis within the urinary system (Eisenberg &amp; Johnson, 2015). &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Patient Care&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A KUB AP Supine Abdomen radiograph is usually ordered to rule out renal calculi. As with all Acute Abdomen Series, always instruct the patient to put on a gown and remove all clothing except for undergarments so that no clothing artifact would appear on the radiogrpah. Often patients coming to the diagnostic imaging department may complain of having extreme flank pain which causes them to limp while walking. When this happens, it would be advisable for the technologist to assist the patient carefully onto the x-ray table prior to positioning. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Center the central ray to the level of the iliac crest to include the pubic symphysis. The greater trochanter of the patient can also be palpated to ensure the pubic symphysis is included in the lower portion of the collimation field. When positioning, avoid touching the sore side to maximize patient comfort. Select the appropriate technical factors and expose at expiration (Lampignano &amp; Kendrick, 2018). &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Imaging Findings&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Radiography&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It should be noted that around 80% of symptomatic patients have visible renal calculi on plain radiographs. However, since not all renal calculi are composed of radiopaque materials, around 34% of all stones are missed on plain abdomen radiographs (Eisenberg &amp; Johnson, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&quot;/ivanklchan.github.io/images/renal-calculi/kub-stones.jpg&quot; class=&quot;pathology-images&quot;&gt;
        &lt;caption&gt;Case coursey of Dr. Frank Gaillard. Radiopaedia.org. From the case: Renal calculus, pre- and post-ESWL&lt;/caption&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In the anteroposterior supine abdomen radiograph above, there is radiopacity in the left kidney suggestive of renal calculi.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&quot;/ivanklchan.github.io/images/renal-calculi/kub-staghorn.jpg&quot; class=&quot;pathology-images&quot;&gt;
        &lt;caption&gt;Staghorn calculi (Eisenberg &amp; Johnson, 2015)&lt;/caption&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The above plain abdomen radiograph shows staghorn calculi bilaterallly. The black arrow is poining to residual contrast left in the spinal canal from a previous spine imaging procedure. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Computed Tomography&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;CT is often the modality of choice because it provides abundant diagnostic information. It is a fast, accurate, and a safe modality. CT also has the ability to detect other pathologies secondary to renal calculi such as infection and hydronephrosis. One disadvantage of CT is the use of ionizing radiation. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&quot;/ivanklchan.github.io/images/renal-calculi/ct-staghorn.jpg&quot; class=&quot;pathology-images&quot;&gt;
        &lt;caption&gt;Transverse CT showing staghorn calculi in left kidney (Eisenberg &amp; Johnson, 2015)&lt;/caption&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The above transverse CT abdomen scan shows a staghorn calculi in the left kidney on a paediatric patient. A non-contrast CT abdomen is usually performed because the usage of contrast media would mask any renal calculi in the urinary system. At the posterior portion of the patient, there is notable streaking artifact at the lumbar vertebrae region.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intravenous Urography&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Intravenous urography can be done when CT is unavailable. This procedure involves the injection of contrast media through a percutaneous insertion of a catheter to the kidney, this method is known as antegrade imaging of the urinary system because contrast flows from kidney to the bladder. Another approach is to inject contrast media through the insertion of a catheter from  the urethra to the bladder, and up to the ureter, this method is retrograde instead. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&quot;/ivanklchan.github.io/images/renal-calculi/fungus-ball.jpg&quot; class=&quot;pathology-images&quot;&gt;
        &lt;caption&gt;Hydronephrosis caused by a Cryptococcus fungus ball obstructing at the UP junction (Eisenberg &amp; Johnson, 2015)&lt;/caption&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Here, we can see what seems to be an antegrade urography suggested by the insertion of a catheter percutaneously to the left kidney. This is an unusual case of a renal &quot;calculi&quot; because the object causing the hydronephrosis is not a stone, but rather a fungus ball obstructing and the urinopelvic junction. Hydronephrosis is evident by the mild distension of the renal calyces on this urograph. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;However, a disadvantage of intravenous urography is infection because we would be puncturing through the skin barrier and introducing instruments from outside to inside of the body. This method of imaging is also not as accurate as CT. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ultrasound&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Ultrasound is used when radiation is contraindicated, as in the case of a pregnancy. It is difficult to find renal calculi using sonography because small stones may remain undetected on sonograms. Ultrasound also requires an experienced and skilled sonographer to discover such stones. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&quot;/ivanklchan.github.io/images/renal-calculi/us-stone.jpg&quot; class=&quot;pathology-images&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;caption&gt;Case courtesy of Dr Maulik S Patel, Radiopaedia.org. From the case Pelvic kidney.&lt;/caption&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is a short axis sonogram of a pelvic kidney demonstrating a renal calculus. Notice the hypoerechoic region between the crosshairs. This is caused by the renal calculus being highly acoustically reflective. We also see the acoustic shadow trailing behind the renal calculus because there are no sound waves passing beyond the kidney stone (Patel, n.d.).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Prevention&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Prevention of renal calculi can involve two methods that utilizes the chemical prinicple of &lt;em&gt;concentration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydration:&lt;/b&gt; Drinking more water dilutes and decreases the concentration of urine. This allows more renal calculi to dissolve and flush out of the body. &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diet:&lt;/b&gt; By decreasing the intake of lithogenic substances such as calcium, oxalate, and uric acid in diet, the concentration of these substances can be reduced in urine. Thus minimizing renal calculi formation. &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Medication&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The injection of litholytic medication into the kidney percutaneous through a catheter or a needle can dissolve stones chemically and allow renal calculi to pass out of the urinary system. The physician may also prescribe medication to be taken orally to dissolve kidney stones. Examples of such medication are &lt;em&gt;allopurinol&lt;/em&gt; to dissolve uric acid stones by acting as an alkalizing agent (Mayo Clinic, 2020), and thiazide diuretics to prevent calcium stones from forming. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Energy&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;There are two methods of using energy to destroy kidney stones&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laser Removal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Laser removal is a sterile procedure performed by the urologist. This procedure involves the insertion of a laser probe in retrograde through the urethra to the bladder and then to the ureter. Once the laser probe is in place and the presence of the stone is confirmed by fluoroscopy, the urologist emitts laser energy aimming to the renal calculi in hopes of breaking the stone into smaller fragments. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;During this procedure, a stent can also be put in place to allow the proper flow of urine.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The radiologic technologist's role in this procedure is primarily imaging. Although the physician is responsible for the administering of radiation, the technologist may need to assist in patient positioning and table movement to achieve the optimal images for diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (Virginia Hospital Center, n.d.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;ESWL is a non-invasive method in which shock waves are delievered to the ureter to break down stones or any substances obstructing the flow of urine along the urinary tract. During an ESWL procedure, the patient can be put under sedation or general anaesthesia and radiography is used to properly aim the shock waves to the correct anatomy. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Although ESWL is non-invasive, this procedure does not guarantee that stones would break post-ESWL. Certain types of stones such as oxlate stones can be resistant to shock waves and that larger stones could still break into smaller fragments that would still block the ureter.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;After ESWL, an abdominal radiograph should be done as a follow up to reassess for any residual fragments present. Proper imaging and treatment are to be taken should any calculi still be present.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Surgical&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Surgical intervention is usually the last resort for treating renal calculi because of its traumatic nature. Patients undergoing this treatment usually have a very long recovery time. Thus, this method is not advisable unless all other treatment options have been exhausted (Eisenberg &amp; Johnson, 2015). &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, renal calculi are stones formed anywhere within the urinary tract. Chemically, they are formed by the supersaturation of urine, which can be caused by a variety of pathological conditions (Prochaska, Taylor, Ferraro &amp; Curhan, 2018).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The most common clinical presentation of renal calculi is flank pain. Laboratory data such as hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria can also indicate a potential presence of kidney stones. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In radiology, diagnosis of renal calculi can be made by radiopacity of the urinary system in plain abdominal radiographs and urographs, hyperdense regions in computed tomography, and certain sonographic appearances such as acoustic shadow trailing behind a hyperechoic region. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Treatment for renal calculi depends on the case. Treatment types can range from non-invasive methods such as ESWL to stenting, and that surgery is reserved as a last resort because of its traumatic and invasive nature. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;Never Assume&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Power of Time&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The accumulating nature of time is almost magical in changing a person, either for better or worse. One day alone may only transform a person negligeably. But if we accumulate these small daily transformations long enough, the power of time can really change a person's perspective on life. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think many people, especially when we finishing undergrad, can confidently say that we are not the same person as we were when we first started college or university.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A general trend I've noticed is that as we grow older and accumulate more experiences in their lives, we tend to become more reserved, rational, quiet, and calm. I am sure we all know of someone obnoxious and annoying from high school who become more quiet and rational when they approach the end of undergrad. And in this blog I really want to talk about how we ought to respond to other people's changes as we straddle through life.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Never Assume&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To be honest, I think most of us are trying our best in our 20s to build our character. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I once saw a tweet appeared on Instagram and it read &lt;i&gt;if you knew me before my 20s, you never actually knew me. You knew season 1 me.&lt;/i&gt; As comedic as it sounds, I believe this tweet defintely stroke a chord in many people's hearts. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/ivanklchan.github.io/images/never-assume-tweet.png&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Think about this question: &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Has someone falsely assumed and mislabelled you negatively right now just because they are stuck in their perception of you a few years ago?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you answer is &lt;b&gt;yes&lt;/b&gt;, I just want to say that you are not alone. I think many of our misunderstandings with people whom we have not reconvened for a long time can often trace back to our falsely assumptions that people do not change. And we falsely jump to the conconclusion that they still remain in the same level of maturity. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I have been the one falsely assuming people that they haven't changed to be a better person after seeing them again from a few years of separation, and I have also been falsely assumed to be the same person as how I presented myself a few years ago - as a braggy, selfish, and ignorant snob that people detested. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But certainly, we can all agree that if you are a recent graduate from college or university, you can confidently say that you are not the same person as you were back when you started undergrad. And I hope you have became a better person, not worse. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So now I want to bring up the concern: &lt;b&gt;&quot;Is it fair to someone if we jump to the conclusion that the person whom we thought was immature and obnoxious when they were younger would still be the same person today?&quot;&lt;/b&gt; I do not think so.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One might argue that &lt;i&gt;&quot;Well, because they were annoying and they did something bad to me a few years ago in high school, it is fair to hate on them and assume that they haven't changed at all.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But I beg to differ. Having prejudice to a person and assuming that the person you haven't met in a long time still has all the negative traits in him or her after a few years of undergrad comes from a sense of being prideful. And this kind of outdated assumption can potentially be toxic and prevent you from reconnecting with your old friends. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Just imagine someone still holding a grudge towards you because of who you were a few years ago. I think you instinctively wouldn't want to associate with a person who assumes the worst coming from you because of a previous minor conflict. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Accept Changes in Yourself and Others Humbly&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the book &lt;i&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age&lt;/i&gt;, the author states that:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;by taking time to research other people's current circumstances you will avoid making assumptions about them&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This quote can't be more true if we want to be more mature in our 20s. And to alter the quote a bit to fit the argument I want to bring up in this blog, we can suggest that &lt;b&gt;if we take time to understand other people's current circumstances, we would prevent ourselves by projecting our outdated assumptions on them.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now I think that is a very humble way of looking at people around us. Instead of &lt;em&gt;&quot;you deserve to be treated badly in a certain way because I still see you the same way I did a few years ago&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, we can express our friendliness by saying &lt;em&gt;&quot;how has this person changed for the better in this period of time?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Notice how the former is &lt;b&gt;condescending&lt;/b&gt;, while the latter displays &lt;b&gt;humbleness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Always realize and see how other people's experiences have shaped them to become a better person.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Assumptions and Judgements Always Hurt Yourself More &lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I loved making assumptions on people because I thought it was somehow a mature trait. I would even hold the belief that my assumptions of others were justified as long as I see myself as &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; mature than them. Obviously through my arrogance youth, I learned things the hard way. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I was prideful when making assumptions on others. My malevolent intent to look down and to hurt people ultimately boomeranged back to myself because my self-inflated ego caused my heart to harden.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When other people and even my close friends began to criticize me, I still wouldn't listen and again I &lt;em&gt;falsely&lt;/em&gt; assumed my dear friends to be arrogant. This has caused several people to walk away from me and eventually created a period of bad mental health to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Always Ask Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To counter our negative assumptions on others, we should keep asking questions. If you want to reconcile or reconnect with a particular person whom you have disconnected with for a long period of time, I suggest to ask these questions: &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;How has this period of time shaped him or her to a better person?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;What are some wisdom that he or she has learned over the past period of time?&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;What are some positive traits about this person that I am not aware of?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;What can I be doing to make him or her feel warmth even after a long time of disconnection?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think when we start asking questions that allows us to know the other person better, we would begin to notice that at the end we are all very similar people but our subjective biases would always inflate our differences and disagreements. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you conclude that the person hasn't changed or even has become worse after you spend the time to reconnect with him or her, then so be it. You will then use your discretion and your wisdom to discern if this person is still someone you want to be acquainted. If not, leave the person as it is and do so quietly. Do not complain or talk against his or her back, as doing so would only compromise your integrity. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;My Coding Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think the two most essential attributes that a web developer or a programmer should have are &lt;i&gt;committment&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;integrity&lt;/i&gt;. I firmly believe that the manifestation of the two aforementioned attributes will propel anyone interested in computer science to excellence regardless of their skill level.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;A Bit of History&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve coded this website entirely by myself. And I don‚Äôt wish to brag because I want to embark you on a journey of how I achieved this level that was once thought impossible by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I had no prior knowledge on coding. But I took a computer language course in grade 10 and I was quickly disgusted by the difficulty of Python. As I progressed through high school, coding gradually became the antithesis of my goal of pursuing a career in health care.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, my views on coding - a seemingly distant inconceivable activity to me, began change in summer of 2019. My journey of becoming a web developer started when I visited my engineering friend's personal website. At that time, coding still felt foreign to me because I saw no use of learning a computer language as a student in a health care program.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But I was soon convicted by the idea of learning something outside of my primary studies of radiography to broaden my skills set. So I challenged myself to learn the basics of web design - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;My Experience in Learning Computer Languages&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For starters, Hypertext markup language (HTML) and cascading styles sheets (CSS) are &lt;i&gt;markup computer languages&lt;/i&gt;. Together, they instruct the browser a set of parameters to display readable content to humans. These languages are the most fundamental and basic computer languages that powers the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you ever wonder what is all that code when you accidentally pressed F12 on a keyboard, those are basically HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Personally, HTML‚Äôs easy readability and its high tolerance to errors made it a great candidate for me to try out coding. It allowed me to familiarize myself with code editors and to learn about the paradigm of computer languages.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So I quickly fired up the ‚ÄúHTML Essential Training‚Äù course on LinkedIn Learning (free membership provided by my local library. YAY) and began to watch their video tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It took me around three to four weeks to get comfortable with HTML. Although a few weeks seemed like a short time to know a computer language, I can guarantee you that HTML is not that hard and that I know computer programmers who mastered it in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After I got some HTML knowledge under my belt, I shifted my attention to CCS. CSS is another markup computer language that is always used alongside HTML. This is because while HTML defines the content, CSS defines the layout of the website such as font size, font type, colours, and margins.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, CSS was more difficult to learn than HTML because of its complex syntax and its heavy reliance on HTML. This means that HTML needs to be coded properly for CSS to work. I‚Äôve had a harder time myself mastering the various techniques to optimize CSS code.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Putting the Theory into Practice&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Once I got a fair amount of knowledge in HTML and CSS, I started building my  website. And I got to say that putting the coding theory into actual practice brought up the difficulty to another dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As I began to build my website, I ran through many trials and errors. Yet, I found myself oddly enjoying the process of problem solving and critical thinking to construct a tangible product I can confidently show others.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Although it took me around two to three months to get my personal website into a rough shape with my fairly new knowledge of web design, I spent another year to refine and to master various ways to improve my code.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think my journey of learning HTML and CSS really allowed me to sharpen my critical thinking and problem solving skills because I submerged myself into a whole different academic field. At least for me as a student in health care, diving into web design and learning a computer language felt like entering into foreign land.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After publishing my website for the first time, I felt grateful and I did feel accomplished because I finally discovered a new hobby that I never expected myself to pick up and I found a new unique way to showcase myself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Stay Humble and Keep Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, the learning process is not finished yet. It is true that I‚Äôve come a long way since a year and a half ago and that my coding skills have improved drastically. But there is still so much more to learn in the field of web design and computer science that I stay humble to keep discovering and keep learning new skills. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As I wrote at the very beginning, the three most essential computer languages that power the world wide web are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am only comfortable with HTML and CSS at the moment and I just got started with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Unlike HTML and CSS, which are markup languages, JavaScript is a programming language that allows user interactivity on the website. Currently, I am getting my hands on JavaScript and I am planning to incorporate more JavaScript powered user interactivity on my personal projects in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Personally I find JavaScript very challenging. Even right now I am having trouble getting to know the basics of the language, which brings me to the topic of giving up and staying committed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Committment or &quot;Cheating&quot;...?&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There were a few people who suggested I could have used a website builder like Wix, Wordpress, or Google Sites to &lt;i&gt;‚Äúmake my life easier‚Äù&lt;/i&gt; because then I would not have to go through the pain of coding.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While I do appreciate my peer‚Äôs opinions, I can‚Äôt imagine calling myself a ‚Äúweb developer‚Äù without actually learning the code. I also see that building my website from scratch without any builders or templates would allow me to take on challenges that are beyond my comfort zone. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Going through the pain of trial and error, debugging the code, and countless times of feeling like I am hitting a wall in my project actually trained up my commitment and concentration skills.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;But I kid you not, there had been multiple times I was on the verge of giving up entirely because I thought to myself ‚Äúwhy on earth am I doing this? It seemed like I was just wasting my time because people weren‚Äôt going to pay attention to my work anyway.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;And then I continued to reaffirm myself that learning to code, learning to build a website, and spending hours on writing blogs and research aren't about getting people to appreciate my work. It‚Äôs about expressing myself in ways that I‚Äôve never imagined before and allow my life‚Äôs calling to find me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;So How Difficult is Coding?&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I am going to say the answer straight: &lt;i&gt;coding is &lt;b&gt;difficult&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Anyone who say &quot;coding is easy&quot; is either 1. &lt;i&gt;at the beginning peak curve of the &lt;b&gt;Dunning-Kurger Effect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which refers to the bias of how people perceive a concept or event to be simplistic just because their knowledge about it may be simple or lacking, or 2. &lt;i&gt;a coding master who cognitively assumes that everyone else is as competent as him or her&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;About 80% of the time, coding felt like hitting brick wall because the things I would expect to work properly would somehow mysteriously fail. And then each problem I was trying to solve would create a few more new problems. This would potentially mean that a project that you anticipated to be easy could end up with &lt;i&gt;hundreds&lt;/i&gt; or even &lt;i&gt;thousands&lt;/i&gt; of issues. 

    &lt;p&gt;A more graphical analogy would be unknowingly sailing into a hurricane when you expected a calm sea.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;But, once I endured the hardship and all the obstacles in the project, suddenly all the mistakes I encountered became invaluable skills and experience that would catapult me to push beyond my comfort level even further to embrace new and more complex challenges.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;h3&gt;We All Learn From Mistakes and We Should Not Give Up&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Although coding is diffocult, I do not want to discourage you from dipping your toes into the vast field of computer science. In fact, I wanted to give an honest opinion based on my experience of becoming a self-taught web developer as a future radiologic technologist.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;We encounter hardships and diffucult moments in every profession or industry we get into. As a student radiologic technologist, I stumble upon countless &lt;i&gt;&quot;hitting a brick wall&quot;&lt;/i&gt; situations in a clinical setting. However, my mindset of problem solving and my commitment to my work are the same regardless if I am health care professional at a hospital or as a web developer.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;Many people I know would immediately dismiss the notion of trying coding because they assume it is boring and hard. But I vow to say that we should all give coding a try before making a sound judgement. Certainty it is not for everyone, but sometimes trying other things could potentially lead you to new discoveries and new passion, and I think this is the most rewarding feeling in life.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;Above all, do not give up easily and stay committed!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;COVID COVID COVID&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In June of 2020, while I was swamped with assignments and projects at the midst of my summer school term, I received an email from my program's professor: &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;We are giving students the option to delay clinical placement by four months from September 2020 to January 2021 because of COVID-19&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;When I skimmed through the email at first, I was little bit surprised. I always thought I had to begin clinical placement in September 2020 just like everyone else and I never really expected the school to give us an option to delay clinical placement. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Reasons Why I Delayed&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The idea of delaying my clinical and graduate later than my peers was inconceivable to me from the start of my academic career. You see, I've always been a very goal oriented and fast-paced person and that I always wanted to finish my studies on time without any hesitation. But, I reread the email again and pondered the question that night: &quot;What would be the reasons for me to delay school?&quot;, and I came up with three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt; 
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Burned out from school:&lt;/b&gt; I've been working and studying for the past two years consistently without breaks. When I took a good look at myself in the mirror, I saw myself drained and lifeless. It seemed like my soul was about to leave my body because I was so consumed with academics and work. I had to remind myself that I've been rough on my body. Quite frankly, I was stressed and I desperately needed a real break for myself. &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lack of personal growth:&lt;/b&gt; Because of my goal-oriented and fast-paced mindset, I often fall into the trap of selective attention. I had been so focused on my goal of graduation on time that I seldomly paid attention to my own personal growth. I rarely reflected and I felt that I had blinded myself to confront my own weaknesses, flaws, and insecurities.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advancing my hobbies:&lt;/b&gt; As mentioned in my previous point, I was too focused on my academic goals that I hardly had any time to explore new skills and advance in my personal interests. I figured out that I could have the potential to excel in my hobbies &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Time for a Break Away from School&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I realized that it is time to take a break to discover myself and to allow my instincts crave what I am truly passionate about, rather be told what to do by the school. When I embraced this philosophy of slowing down and taking things at my own pace, I started to think differently.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think one of the most delustive doctrine that many students unknowingly follow is the idea that we &lt;i&gt;have to&lt;/i&gt; finish our academic endeavours within a constrained amount of time. For example, I was told to finish my university program in four years because it was written in some university handbook in 2017. We were all told to graduate as soon as possible and get a stable job, and we have entrusted this belief to be some sort of magical recipe to a &quot;successful life&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But life is more than just aiming to complete our studies &quot;on time&quot;, or in some extreme cases, I've seen people who would &quot;fast track&quot; their studies for an earlier graduation. Now, whenever I am approached by someone who blatantly brags about their &quot;fast track&quot; graduation plans, I begin to feel a sense of absurdity because there is absolutely no rush to finish our studies when compared to the grand scheme of life. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some of my friends I know who are working or studying constantly without taking breaks are taking a toll on their personal mental health. I think working hard isn't the issue, the problem is that we often &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; &quot;workaholics&quot; and prevent ourselves from taking neccessary breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I mean, would I have delayed school if COVID-19 didn't occur? Probably not. But I am really grateful that I was able to use the extraordinary situation of COVID-19 to change my perspective on the notion of &quot;graduating on time&quot; and not be afraid to take breaks for our own personal development.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Ironically, The Most Productive Four Months Ever&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I thought that these four months in the abscence of formal academic work would be unproductive because I wouldn't have someone else of authority like a professor or a supervisor to keep me on track. Initially I was indeed unproductive because I found myself  sleeping in and bingeing on TV shows. But after a week or two of slacking off / being a waste finally kickstarted myself to just do something meaningful. So I asked myself &lt;i&gt;seriously&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;b&gt;&quot;What is a meaningful and a productive task I can do now?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After I asked myself that question, I relaxed and slowly allowed my instincts to guide me towards a task that I've always wanted to finish but was unable to complete because of school. So I went on to LinkedIn Learning on my computer, searched up &lt;i&gt;&quot;JavaScript Essential Training&quot;&lt;/i&gt; by &lt;i&gt;Morten Rand-Hendriksen&lt;/i&gt;, and began the lessons. &lt;i&gt;&quot;WOW&quot;&lt;/i&gt;, I said to myself, &quot;I finally is able to do what I am passionate about&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Okay I got to admit that my JavaScript knowledge is still very novel. But I realized that once I allowed my passion to take over, the productivity automatically follows. And I think this increase in productivity somehow drenches my blood with dopamine that I sought further tasks and goals. I then signed up for Government French classes to finally pick up learning the language again after only taking French in Grade 8. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Though I need to be honest, there were times I procrastinated even if I was passionate about something. Sometimes I wondered if I slacked off way too much too in these four months. But I constantly reminded myself that I shouldn't be too hard on myself because technically I am on a little break away from school. Out of habit I gradually allocated a time within a week (usually on weekends) to deflate and do nothing, &lt;i&gt;literally nothing&lt;/i&gt;. If it means for me to just scroll on Instagram or browse memes for two hours, I would permit myself to do it because I needed time off. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The most significant change for me in these four months was my own personal growth. As I mentioned before, my indifference towards my own personal growth when I was in school on campus was largely caused by the busyness of school and little bit of my ignorance. When I had my four months off, I gradually developped a habit of talking walks outside. And in these times of solitude I reflected deeply and pondered on my shortcomings and my weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Gradually, I noticed I became more self-aware at myself. Instead of paying attention to other people's businesses, I started to divert my attention internally. My eyes, which were once blinded to my own flaws because of my arrogance, began to notice my weaknesses. My soul soon followed the lead of my eyes to began working on changes to improve myself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I also picked up several habits that aided my transformation in these four months. I began to read more and surprisingly, reading has this magical ability to make me reflect and ponder on my world views. I also started journalling. Journalling is a good way to keep track of your life and observe how your actions and thoughts transform gradually over time. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/ivanklchan.github.io/images/post-banners/finances-intro-pic.jpg&quot;&gt;

    &lt;small&gt;DISCLAIMER: All financial information presented here are opinions of my own and do not constitute professional advice. Please consult a qualified finance professional for your financial decisions. I am not liable for any financial losses.&lt;/small&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;‚ÄúWhat Stocks Should I Buy?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As someone who is adequately knowledgeable in personal finances, the most common question I receive from people is: ‚ÄúIvan, can you tell me what stocks I should buy?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Frankly, sometimes I get a little bit frustrated when I hear this question because I believe we should have a good foundational finance knowledge before investing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Investing is futile when we are not well financially educated. It is like trying to drive on a highway first without learning how to stop properly at stop signs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I am not talking about economical concepts like ‚Äúsupply and demand‚Äù, but rather speaking about budgeting and planning our personal finances. Sadly, this is where a lot of people become disinterested and stop their conquest for financial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Lack of Financial Education&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It is astounding how financially uneducated we are. Especially in our consumer culture, it is shocking that our incentives to be at least aware of our financial decisions are painfully low.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, I am not surprised because financial education was not taught at school, at least for my generation. It is only until very recently that the Ontario Government decided to include financial literacy as part of the elementary school curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So many of us are and will be entering university or college with zero or few financial knowledge, and yet some of us receive large sums of financial aid from our parents or from the government without guidance on how to manage the money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This situation leaves many young adults at stake and vulnerable when we enter the workplace after graduation. I think that learning to manage our finances while we still have time for trial and error in university can prevent us from making uninformed and regretful financial decisions later in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Keep Track of Your Expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think developing a habit to keep track of our expenses is the forefront of becoming financially literate because just visualizing our spending provides us with awareness of certain spending trends.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I use Mint to keep track of my credit and debit card expenses and I review my spending records every week. It is actually quite an easy habit to do. Every week and every month I tally my total spending and to pinpoint any miscellaneous pointless expenses I made. From that, I write a little weekly or monthly summary on how I could have improved to avoid the same spending mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Mint is just a tool I use because it automatically tracks my credit and debit card transactions. You can also use Google Keep or any notes app you prefer to manually keep track of your spending. Just make sure to document any cash transactions as they can easily be missed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve seen huge improvements in my spending habits after I started tracking my spending. I became more financially conservative and more aware of my spending before I make any purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The image below illustrates an example:&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;img src=&quot;/ivanklchan.github.io/images/expenses-tracking-pic.jpg&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I always remind myself that spending $5 isn‚Äôt much. But if I spend $5 everyday, that would account for $150 extra expenses each month. Always remember that small pointless expenses add up!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h&gt;Save Up Your Money&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Chances are some of us have some sort of part time income during university. Instead of spending nearly all your hard-earned dollars on a shopping spree, I suggest saving up at least 10 to 15% of your earnings each month.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Despite 10 to 15% might not seem much, especially to those people earning minimum wage. But developing this habit of saving yourself money first when the paycheque arrives will allow us to be more financially aware and fiscally conservative in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Invest Your Money&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Once you have good finance foundation knowledge, it is time to invest your money. Again, I can‚Äôt stress more the importance of having enough financial knowledge before investing because without such knowledge it is like learning to run before walking.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs tempting to believe that leaving cash in a bank account is the best way to ‚Äúsave‚Äù money. However, time will prove this concept wrong because of inflation. The same $100 today is not the same $100 ten years ago because we realize the prices of goods and services increase over time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Keeping money in a bank account will only slowly depreciate the value of the money.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Many of us overlook taxes as an expense without realizing a quarter of our salary goes to the government. Another way to look at this is that we work three months out of a year to keep nothing for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Any investment we do should have a return high enough to cover up inflation and taxes expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are many types of investments out there - stocks, securities, mutual funds, ETFs, precious metals, real estate, and many more. This goes back to the question that many of my peers ask me:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;What stocks should I buy?&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I refrain from giving any specific stock recommendations because I don‚Äôt want to be liable for my peers‚Äô financial loss. It is also tricky to answer this question because everyone has different financial situations and risk tolerances. One investment may suit a person well but could be detrimental to another person‚Äôs financial health.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What I suggest is to figure out your own personal financial needs and research on investments that fits your personal needs. Ask yourself questions such as ‚ÄùWhat are my goals‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat am I passionate about?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat are my risk tolerances?‚Äù. Ask a qualified financial professional for help. I am confident that you can find a finance professional just by asking your family and your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Remember that no one is responsible for your money other than yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Keep Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The world of personal finance is vast. We need to be informed and consistently learn through experiences to be competent in our future financial decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Many people I know refuse to start investing because they fear losing money. And I understand the fear. In fact, no one would want their hard earned dollars vanish overnight in the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is why being financially educated and informed is the cornerstone of achieving financial independence at a young age. We will be able to manage our finances and invest wisely. We will inevitably incur some loss when we invest and that is ok because we all learn from our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;No one can predict the future and no investment is guaranteed to make us rich. We cannot control the stock market but we can control our own finances by being financially educated when we are still in university.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;‚ÄúThe Fall‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always thought of my first year as a ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù or en fran√ßais &lt;i&gt;‚Äúla lune de miel‚Äù&lt;/i&gt; phase of university. This is especially true when I am reflecting back as a fourth year student. Although I had a tough time adjusting myself to the university workload, I was not vulnerable mentally and this caused me to underestimate the heaviness of life in university.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;It was a fun time. I had great social, academic support, and I thrived. I thought I was living the best life. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But then, something happened in second year. I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint the exact thing, but I think it was a series of vague realizations that caused a deterioration in optimism and mental health as second year commences, and I can confidently say that many of my peers began to experience a downfall as the reality of university life sank in.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To this day, I still think that the transition from first year to second year is heavier than the transition from high school to first year, and it is a topic that not many people touch on. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Changes in Mentality&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Of course, I speak of my own experience. But I‚Äôve noticed a shift in mentality in myself and my peers as we enter second year. My social battery was on overdrive in first year because it was the prime time to ‚Äúmake new friends‚Äù, ‚Äújoin new clubs‚Äù, and ‚Äútry new things‚Äù. First year was the time when I wanted to expand my social circle to as big as possible and tried to be liked by everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Cliche Advice: ‚ÄúJust be Yourself‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I realized that people are inherently different. Not the small differences between an orange and a clementine, but more like comparing an apple to a durian. I was surrounded by people similar to me in high school, as a result, conflicts between my high school peers and I were easily resolved because our values were similar.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to second year, I noticed that my conquest to become liked by everyone began to crumble. When I realized I am not liked by everyone, the feeling of failure and loneliness started to battle my mental well-being. I would appear to be very happy on the outside but broken inside. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I spent a great deal of time in second year trying to live up to other people‚Äôs standards. I am an introvert, but I would party and drink like there was no tomorrow to grab people‚Äôs attention. It felt great for a short time. It felt like I was accomplishing something. However, as time went on and the reality of life squeezed in, my emotions fell apart like jello. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It took me at least two years for the cliche advice of ‚Äújust be yourself‚Äù to be drilled inside my brain. I realized that people accept me a lot more for being myself than trying to live for someone else. &lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;h3&gt;I Am Not The Centre of The Universe&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Psychology calls it ‚Äúself-serving bias‚Äù, ‚Äúspotlight effect‚Äù, or the ‚Äúfundamental attribution error‚Äù. I don‚Äôt major in psychology but I have took a introductory psychology course in first year. To put it simply, it is our inherent bias that we tend to overestimate our importance in this world. And I have done exactly that in my second year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When I took an emotional downturn in second year from trying to live up to other people‚Äôs standards, I started to expect others to reach out to me or to care for me because well‚Ä¶ I am sad and why aren‚Äôt the people I spent time knowing back in first year not caring about me?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now I want to make this clear - my friends are nice. My point is that it was my fault at &lt;b&gt;expecting&lt;/b&gt; others to pour their attention onto me, while I was ignorant about my friends having their own issues to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Not knowing that I have fallen into the spotlight effect and continue to seek validation, I became rude, arrogant, ignorant, and entitled. I became less thankful, less grateful, and judgemental. All of which tore apart my social circle slowly throughout second year as I fought with loneliness and guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In third year, I had an amazing talk with my housemate about my issues. He brought up a point - &lt;b&gt;‚ÄúIt is a two way process, you can‚Äôt expect other people to give into you if you haven‚Äôt reached out to them in the first place‚Äù.&lt;/b&gt; His worlds lit a bulb in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why hadn‚Äôt I thought of that from the very beginning?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It took me a long time to notice this - I am not the centre of the universe. Yes, it doesn‚Äôt feel great sometimes that the people I pour in is not reciprocating back to me, but I believe the action of just &lt;i&gt;reaching out&lt;/i&gt; will definitely come a long, long way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Express Less s More&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Despite being an introvert myself, I was an overactive person. I don‚Äôt necessarily yell or show aggression to people, but I had the tendency to express my opinions or mind other people‚Äôs business more than usual. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think it may have evolved from my affinity for attention at the beginning of my second year, like somehow I felt being overactive would somehow make me more popular. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There had been some instances when my overactive personality backfired on me, and caused damage to my reputation. To this day I still regret certain unnecessary expressions or opinions I made that had caused people to distrust me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The mistakes I made were first, I talked too much, and second, I cared too much about other people‚Äôs business. I directed my attention externally rather than internally, this was a horrible mistake because as I focused on other people‚Äôs life, I was completely unaware of the downfall of my mental state. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Why did I spend so much attention on things I cannot control (other people‚Äôs lives), but neglected on things I can control (myself)?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I am beginning to notice that by talking less, I am able to divert my attention internally, which unexpectedly gives me more time to self-reflect, self-evaluate, and pinpoint issues of myself - things I can control. Hence, talk less is &lt;b&gt;more&lt;/b&gt; because I can reroute my energy and attention to self-growth, self-actualization, self-awareness, and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These are the words from the book cover of Atomic Habits by James Clear. It‚Äôs funny how I thought the opposite of that statement was true ‚Äî ‚ÄúBIG changes, remarkable results.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Whenever I have a huge revelation or whenever I discover something magnificent in my life, for example, learning the guitar, I would always pour in the majority of my attention in trying to develop a habit ‚Äî let say practicing chords for one hour everyday into my schedule. More often, these loaded habits that I am trying to squish into my schedule often end up in failure because I either lose motivation or I stop the habit for a few days then I never pick it back up again, leaving the habit I wanted to learn in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think we all encounter this problem a lot. We want to develop a good habit or break a bad habit, but the changes we implement in our lives are often too big, so big that it overflows us with confusion that we don‚Äôt expect. Then after a while we get overwhelmed by the impracticality of our new changes and eventually give up.

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Solving My Sleep Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always struggled with going to bed early, and I love to blame it on my body for being a ‚Äúlight sleeper‚Äù, or ‚Äúoh because my body naturally takes longer time to fall asleep‚Äù. But, I firmly believe that through incrementally implementing tiny changes to my daily habits, I can sleep early AND fall asleep fast.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;Let me explain how.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;h3&gt;The Habit Loop&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the book, James Clear introduced the habit loop, basically it is a sequence of events that must occur for a good habit to stick or a bad habit to break, the graph looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;img src=&quot;/ivanklchan.github.io/images/habit-loops.jpg&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For many instances, the visual cue of a bed brings me tiredness. This has caused me to take naps in late afternoon or early evening and push my sleep time at night way past midnight to three or even four in the morning. This makes me wake up at around noon to one in the afternoon. I‚Äôve tried taking sleeping pills to adjust my sleep schedule and to reset my biological clock. Sadly, taking such medication has proven only to be a temporary relief as I return back to my bad habits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My first step is to create and implement the intention: ‚ÄúWhen situation X arises, I will perform response Y.‚Äù That is, when I feel tired at night, I will go back to my bedroom. For that, I decided to move my workspace to another location in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The second step involves linking the cue of being tired to crave sleep on my bed. I turn off all my electronic devices and put my phone at an unreachable location within my room so I would not scroll my phone on my bed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My response to the cue in my second step would be falling asleep with no distractions, and then my reward would be waking up early and energized. Thus, starting a new day fresh and early, reinforcing the habit of sleeping early&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;‚ÄùBut, I am a light sleeper‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I admit that there are people who are light sleepers and people who fall asleep in a snap. In fact, my brother falls asleep within three minutes he hits his bed. While I do believe that we could be psychologically or genetically inclined to being a light sleeper, forming good habits can triumph our genetic predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Children of Consumer Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We live in a consumer culture. Everyday we are bombarded constantly by advertisements to purchase the latest phone, car, andgadget. Everyday we are surrounded by a ‚Äúhypebeast‚Äù mentality that makes us think purchasing luxury items is somehow a ‚Äúgoal‚Äù we ought to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Millionaire Next Door asks a simple question in the beginning of the book:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What comes to your mind when you hear the word Millionaire?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think most of us, or at least me, would imagine a person who is earning a six figure salary living in a grandeur house in an upscale neighbourhood. They have a collection of luxury cars, the newest smartphones, enjoy the best food, and probably have a pet too. They have a lifestyle which resembles the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù, the ideal goal that we strive for - and that is why we study so hard in school, thinking that obtaining a university degree would magically push ourselves to the ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù middle-class in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;I used quotation marks around the word ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù above because as the authors continue throughout the book, it completely changed my view on wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Wealth - &lt;i&gt;Redefined&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As I read more, a question popped into my head: &lt;i&gt;What if my neighbour next door, who is living in a small and modest house, driving a 2005 Toyota Corolla to work, is actually a millionaire?&lt;/i&gt; This question I asked myself immediately went in conflict with what I believed a ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù person is. Think about it, &lt;i&gt;how could someone living in a normal neighbourhood, driving an second-handed old car, still use an iPhone 6S (at the time of this writing, the iPhone 12 just came out) a millionaire? I mean I would assume he is just like me, there is no way he could be a millionaire.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly to me, the stereotypical ‚Äúrich‚Äù person that we usually think may actually be quite unwealthy. The authors first reason that assets appreciate and accumulate to become wealth. From this reasoning, they argue that houses and expensive cars are not assets because they depreciate in value. These so-called ‚Äúassets‚Äù quickly become liabilities when we account for maintenance costs and loan payments. For example, a physician earns $250,000 annually, that puts him in the ‚Äúrich‚Äù category, but if all his earnings are spent on expenses to maintain a high social status lifestyle with no assets on the stock market, he is unwealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To put it simply, wealth can be defined as the amount of time you can sustain your current lifestyle should you become unemployed with no source of income. This definition shocked me because Inever thought of wealth this way. Referring to the physician example I gave in the previous paragraph, if for whatever reason he loses his job, he may not be able to maintain his lifestyle for more than a year. After that, his family could be struggling to live normally,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The author interviewed many millionaires, and some of them actually earned less than $100,000 a year ($60,000 in 1996 USD). Nearly every millionaire interviewed said that the key to become wealthy is being frugal, hard work, and self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Frugal, hard work, and self-discipline are three things that constantly intertwine each other. To be frugal, we have to put in the hard work and the self-discipline to maintain your frugality. Millionaires spend at least twice the amount of time than the average person on financial planning and they make their own financial decisions, that requires hard work and dedication.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Living frugally goes against our consumer culture. It means buying things that we need, not what we want, and this allows us to evaluate our spending and to live well below our means. Think about it this way, how could a person accumulate wealth if he spends all 90% of his earnings to keep up his luxury lifestyle, leaving almost nothing left to invest?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We need self-discipline to keep our frugality and hard work in check. It allows consistency in thoughts and in actions. There is no point if we stay frugal for a month but then go with our expenses unchecked for the rest of the year. I think having self-discipline also means saying no to certain social events in life. Sure, we may have a bit of ‚Äúfomo‚Äù. But I think trying to attend every social event we are invited to at the expense of potentially accumulating wealth, is unhealthy for our own financial health.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I used to think that the only way to become a rich was to earn at least a six figure salary, then somehow money would magically pour into my bank account. But throughout reading this book, I‚Äôve been proven wrong and wrong again. It is relieving that I need a huge salary to achieve financial independence, but it puts weight into my heart that there are a lot of financial habits I need to work on. Even so, I am confident that I can achieve my financial goals through frugality, hard work, and self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
            
    &lt;p&gt;Radiographic machines utilize large and small FSS to optimize spatial resolution and heat dissipation. This experiment examined the relationship between FSS and the R using a star pattern test tool in two different CR systems. The distance from the outermost margin of the test tool to the regions of zero contrast were evaluated in both axes to determine the experimental FSS and R. The results were consistent with the theory that the larger nominal FSS will produce less detail than the smaller nominal FSS. The smaller FSS deviated from its nominal FSS (31.7-45.0%) more than the larger FSS (0.8-1.0%). The calculated R was relatively low for all trials (1.40-2.23 lp/mm) as a result of the large OID used. The variance noted from nominal figures likely resulted from focal spot blooming, human error related to visual acuity, and as a result of the limitations of digitization of the data by the equipment. Understanding the effect of FSS on spatial resolution can allow the technologist to optimize the use of radiographic equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;This lab examined the relationship between FSS and limiting resolution of an x-ray machine using a star pattern test tool. An x-ray tube is comprised of a cathode and anode. The cathode releases electrons that strike and cause x-ray emission from the actual focal spot on the anode. The actual FSS and the angle of the anode determine the size of the resultant x-ray photon beam, known as the nominal FSS [1]. The line-focus principle states steeper anode angulation results in a larger actual focal spot and smaller nominal focal spot. The anode heel effect states lesser intensity of the x-ray beam at the anode side due to beam absorption by the anode material; the greater the angulation, the more severe the effect [1]. FSB is the increase in FSS due to electron repulsion when higher tube current and lower tube voltages are used [2]. Magnification is the enlargement of an image compared to its actual size and can be calculated by SID/SOD [1]. Star pattern test tools can be used to determine FSS and resolution by evaluating regions of blurring due to penumbra effects; it measures along (FSS&lt;sub&gt;A-C&lt;/sub&gt;) and across (FSS&lt;sub&gt;U-D&lt;/sub&gt;) the A-C axis. Penumbra is the geometric unsharpness present at the periphery of the x-ray beam, and influences the level of scatter in an image [1]. Spurious resolution is an image artifact due to negative MTF; line pairs appear to switch, with dark lines appearing light and vice versa. It is a result of edge-band distribution, a distribution in which photon concentration is highest at the outer edges of a focal spot and lowest in the centre [3]. Experimental data should show smaller focal spot sizes improve resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;MATERIALS AND METHODS&lt;/h3&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;This experiment was conducted in McMaster University Institute of Applied Health Sciences (IAHS) Room B114. The radiographic equipment used in this experiment was Philips DigitalDiagnost and Siemens Multix Fusion Max. A 1¬∞ star pattern test tool, Model 07-542 (Fig. 1), was taped to the x-ray tube with line pair sectors aligned parallel and perpendicular to the anode-cathode axis. A series of images were acquired with CR cassettes according to the parameters in Table 1. The WW and WL of the acquired images were adjusted so to assess them.&lt;/p&gt;  

    &lt;h3&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;Refer to the Appendix for observations and results of all calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The information provides many insights to the functioning of x-ray machines and the impact of FSS on discernable detail. The SOD was set to exactly half of the SID, thus, a magnification of 2x is expected. Using experimental data, magnification was calculated to be 2.31x. The relationship shown in the experimental data supported the assumption that FSS&lt;sub&gt;A-C&lt;/sub&gt; was closer to the nominal value than the calculated FSS&lt;sub&gt;U-D&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, all subsequent analysis focuses on the FSS&lt;sub&gt;A-C&lt;/sub&gt;. When comparing the percentage change between nominal and calculated FSS, the large FSS setting was accurate, with a -0.8 to -1.0% difference. However, a much greater disparity of +31.7 to +45.0% was observed with the small FSS. Limiting resolution was calculated to be relatively low at 1.40-2.23 lp/mm, while CR systems generally have resolutions of 6 lp/mm [1]. The OID was half of the SID, causing penumbra of the remnant beam to diverge more than in a clinical setting, resulting in the low resolution [1].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the acquired images, the line pairs of the star pattern reappeared more central to the blurred regions. These were areas of spurious resolution and could not be accepted as they were an optical illusion and may not accurately reflect the object [3]. The line focus principle and the anode heel effect affect image quality. Essentially, from a bird‚Äôs eye view, the focal spot becomes smaller when moving from cathode to anode, resulting in greater spatial resolution as the exposure decreases [4]. This phenomena allows positioning of patients such that the anode heel acts as a filter; thicker anatomy can be positioned at the cathode side to ensure a more uniform exposure. However, it may also result in burnout or insufficient exposure if not taken into account [1]. The results supported the theory, as the distance to which detail was resolvable was found to be greater on the anode side versus the cathode side. The method of image acquisition can have an impact on the resolution of an acquired image. Film-screen results in a high level of spatial resolution, being superior to CR which itself is superior to DR. However, non-screen film is capable of the highest spatial resolution as it lacks blur-inducing intensifying screens used to increase signal intensity in film-screen [1].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Several potential sources of error exist in the experiment. These factors were partially mitigated as multiple individuals assessed the images and lab set-up, however it was impossible to remove all human error such as slight inaccuracies when setting SID and the placement of the star pattern tool. Assessment of line pairs and image blurring were subjective and limited by the visual acuity of experimenters as well as the quality of the digital image display [5]. Furthermore, FSB may have contributed to error. At equivalent technical factors, electrons would experience a greater repulsive force at a smaller FSS due to their greater proximity [2]. This may have contributed to the greater variation in the experimental small FSS and greater size compared to the nominal FSS. Finally, sampling frequency and digitization of the images may have resulted in the loss of detail, as well as the individual variation between images [6].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The experiment indicated a relatively low resolution in all trials (1.40-2.23 lp/mm), potentially due to greater penumbra from the large OID. Data supported the theory that spatial resolution with a small FSS is higher than with a large FSS, and that nominal FSS is based on its length. The smaller FSS deviated from the nominal FSS more (31.7-45.0%) than the larger FSS (0.8-1.0%). The subjective assessment of images, focal spot blooming, and digitization are potential limitations in the accuracy of this experiment. Technologists should be aware of the effect of FSS on spatial resolution, and the importance of using test tools to ensure maintained image quality.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
            
    &lt;p&gt;This experiment served to assess how AEC is impacted by changing variables. Collimation, centering, and patient size selection were all adjusted to assess how they impacted AEC performance and resultant image quality. A Phillip‚Äôs general radiography system was used in conjunction with a single pelvis phantom for the purposes of imaging. From the data acquired, it is clear that narrower collimation benefits image quality by reducing scatter and increasing fine detail. Correct positioning is also vital to image production as it ensures a correct exposure occurs for the patient size. Finally, technologists must estimate patient size appropriately to ensure proper AEC functioning. All of the above factors impact kVp and mAs, the two factors which determine the quality of image that can be produced. Proper estimation of size will allow AEC systems to calibrate their responses more favourably to the patient‚Äôs characteristics. While AEC is useful, it has limitations and technologists must make use of techniques described in this report to work the technology in their favour.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keywords: automatic exposure control (AEC), digital radiography (DR), kilovoltage peak (kVp), milliampere-second (mAs), dose area product (DAP), exposure index (EI), image receptor (IR)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;This lab examined the effects of specific variables (collimation, patient size and photocell selection) on AEC function. AEC monitors real-time radiation levels to determine when an appropriate amount of exposure has been emitted, and thus when to stop exposure [1]. Dose refers to the amount of radiation absorbed by patients as a result of an exposure and is measured in Grays. It is directly related to DAP, which assesses patient dose while considering exposed area [2]. mAs indicates how much radiation is produced, by the number of photons emitted over a period of time. mAs refers to the product of the current applied to the x-ray tube, and the exposure time. The maximum energy of any individual electron is given by kVp; higher kVp results in higher photon and energy fluence, respectively, the number of photons and the amount of energy had by every photon [3]. Due to kVp‚Äôs dual impact, a 15% reduction in kVp has the same impact on imaging as halving mAs [4]. EI is a unitless measure inversely proportional to the detector air kerma, K, and is derived from a ‚Äúcharacteristic‚Äù pixel value of the image [5]. EI informs the operator how well the system believes the exposure occurred. This information is all relevant to the functioning of AEC and assessing its response to changing scenarios. Experimental data should show that larger collimation will increase scatter and lower quality, smaller patient size should require lower exposure, and incorrect positioning will prevent proper AEC function.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;MATERIALS AND METHODS&lt;/h3&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;This experiment was conducted with Philips x-ray equipment. A pelvis phantom was positioned erect and centred for a lateral L5-S1 at the wall bucky. The centre photocell and a small focal spot size were selected. The AEC and back-up timer were activated. Refer to Table 1 for technical factors of images. Due to equipment limitations, a FOV of 13 cm √ó 13 cm was used instead of 5‚Äù √ó 5‚Äù, and Figure 5 was scanned with the phantom moved anteriorly 2 inches, to simulate selection of a lateral detector cell.&lt;/p&gt;  

    &lt;h3&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;Refer to the Appendix for exposure information and x-ray images.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Many data variables were compared from the images. When comparing Figure 1 and 2, more scatter was present in Figure 2 due to the larger collimation [3]. This caused more dose accumulation, and thus premature exposure cessation. With lower exposure, the resultant image had slightly more noise and less detail than Figure 1.  DAP of Figure 1 and 2 were similar because Figure 2 had a lower exposure over a larger area.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, Figure 2 had a lower EI than Figure 1, meaning the system believed the exposure was higher. The scatter radiation was misinterpreted as a good exposure. Figure 5, with an extremely low EI of 11 was interpreted by the system to be greatly overexposed [5]. However, the AEC chamber was not directly behind the ROI and received unattenuated beam resulting in the x-ray beam cutting out early, creating an underexposed image. The images were still diagnostic due to the use of a DR system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;DR systems offer exceptional dynamic range, being able to capture data with huge variances in intensity [6]. Images widely under or overexposed remain permissible due to advanced algorithms that de-noise, sharpen, and modulate contrast. Post-processing is used to better display specific characteristics after an image is taken [4]. This versatility is not offered by film systems because the crystals embedded in the film darken linearly with exposure, and have dynamic range much narrower than DR [6]. Thus, film systems have much smaller margins of error, as small errors can cause completely non-diagnostic images. Therefore, if AEC is used and the exposure occurs for an excessively long period, the image will not be diagnostic and there would be excessive dose to patients. To prevent this, back-up timers exist which limit the maximum possible AEC exposure [2]. This limit prevents AEC from over-irradiating patients due to inaccurate positioning or possible malfunctioning. Back-up timers normally engage at about 1.5 times maximum exposure for an image type [2]. The maximum radiation allowed by a back-up timer is 500 mAs in Ontario [7].&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Larger patients require higher mAs as more photons are needed to properly image them, while smaller patients require a lower mAs [2]. This relationship is also shown with the experimental data, with technical factors adjusting kVp down for smaller patient size. In addition, to protect smaller patients from over exposure, Philips has back-up timer mAs limits of 100 and 60 for children and infants, respectively. This is why both images using child and infant settings reached their limits, as the beam was forced to traverse the phantom‚Äôs adult thickness volume. Post-processing algorithms may have adjusted for a smaller expected patient, resulting in EI values indicating higher relative exposure. Finally, when the use of a lateral AEC cell was mimicked, exposure stopped very quickly with very low radiation release, but a very high EI. This is because the AEC chamber received almost unattenuated beam. Thus, it reached the upper limit of exposure very quickly and calculated a very highly exposed image, when in fact the phantom was underexposed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The results highlight the importance of AEC, as it is a system that can adjust exposure to reduce dose while ensuring a sufficient number of photons reach the IR. With the use of real-time data, AEC decreases errors in technologists‚Äô technical factor selection with different patients. Experimental data supported the theory about AEC. Larger collimation increased scatter, resulting in earlier termination of exposure while lower technical factors (used with smaller patient size) required longer exposures and yielded a lower dose to the patient. In addition, AEC stopped exposure quickly if improper positioning or photocell selection over a less dense area was done. It is vital to position properly over the ROI for AEC to function accurately. As well, technologists should be aware of pathologies or appliances that would affect AEC function. If these points are kept in mind, it will allow for the creation of better images while ensuring limited dose.&lt;/p&gt;
