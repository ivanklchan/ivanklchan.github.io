            <p>As a future radiologic technologist, I am passionate in the interwoven field of anatomy and technology. Diagnostic imaging has always fascinated me since I was a high school student because of its technical aspect along with the rewarding experience of patient care.</p>

            <p>During my studies at McMaster University, I have developed great interest in interventional radiology and computed tomography because of their minimal invasive nature and their versatility. Furthermore, I have gained valuable interpersonal experiences my clinical placements. </p>

            <p>In my personal time, I love to read and write. I've also learned a few computer languages which allowed me to broaden my skill set outside of my primary studies. This website is an example of my work and showcases my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
