<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The word <b>spondylolisthesis</b> has two parts: <i>spondylo-</i> meaning spine and <i>-listhesis</i> meaning slippage. Thus, spondylolisthesis refers to the slippage or <b>sublaxation</b> of one vertebrae relative another. Although spondylolisthesis can occur anywhere along the verteral column, it most commonly affects the <b>lumbar spine.</b></p>

<p>Spondylolisthesis is often confused and associated with <b>spondylolysis</b>, which describes a defect in the <i>pars interarticularis</i>. Spondylolysis can lead to spondylolisthesis but it is NOT the only cause of spondylolisthesis.</p>

<p>Spondylolisthesis have more specific terms to describe the direction of slippage:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Anteriolisthesis</b>: vertebrae slipped anteriorly.</li>
    <li><b>Retrolisthesis</b>: vertebrae slipped posteriorly.</li>
    <li><b>Laterolisthesis</b>: vertebrae slipped laterally.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SPONDYLOLISTHESIS CLASSIFICATION</h3>

<p>There are six types of spondylolisthesis:</p> 

<ol> 
    
    <li><b>Dysplastic:</b> Congenital defect of the vertebra.</li> 

    <li><b>Isthmic:</b> Defect of the pars interarticularis, such as a fracture.</li>  
    
    <li><b>Degenerative:</b> Common in older patients, involves in arthritic changes in vertebral joints due to cartilage degeneration.</li> 

    <li><b>Traumatic:</b> Direct blunt injury or trauma that causes spondylolisthesis.</li> 
    
    <li><b>Pathologic:</b> Spondylolisthesis is caused by a defect of the bone, such as tumour.</li> 
    
    <li><b>Post-laminectomy:</b> Spondylolisthesis occurs after the surgery called post-laminectomy</li> 

</ol>
        
<h3>STAGING OF SPONDYLOLISTHESIS</h3> 

<p>Physicians use the <b>Meryerding Classification</b> to diagnose the staging of spondylolisthesis from radiographs. The Meryerding Classification measures the displacement of the vertebra relative to the superior endplate of the vertebrae below by dividing the superior endplate to 1/4 parts.</p> 

<p>There are five stages to the Meryerding Classification.</p> 

<ol>
    
    <li>Vertebrae displaced up to <b>1/4</b> relative to superior endplate of the vertebrae below.</li>
    <li>Vertebrae displaced up to <b>1/2</b> relative to superior endplate of the vertebrae below.</li>
    <li>Vertebrae displaced up to <b>3/4</b> relative to superior endplate of the vertebrae below.</li>
    <li>Vertebrae displaced up the <b>entire</b> superior endplate of the vertebrae below.</li>
    <li>Complete <b>dislocation</b> of the vertebrae.</li>
    
</ol>

<h3>RISKS AND SYMPTOMS</h3>

<p>Several factors can put an individual at risk of spondylolisthesis. Individuals who have a fmaily history of back problems, congenital spondylolysis, repeated stress such as excessive lower back hyperextension, and trauma can develop spondylolisthesis.</p> 

<p>Symptoms of spondylolisthesis are: lower back pain, stiffness in <b>hamstring muscle</b> - muscle group that flexes the knee and extends the hip, decreased range of motion of lower back, numbness and tinging, and weakness of legs. Spondylolisthesis can also punch nerves and cause radiating nerve pain to the lower extremities.</p>

<h3>RADIOGRAPHIC ROUTINE</h3> 

<p>Four views of the lumbar spine are usually taken for spondylolisthesis. However, radiogrpahic routines may defer between insititutions. The four views of the lumbar spine are:</p> 

<ol> 
    
    <li><b>AP</b></li> 
    
    <li><b>LATERAL</b></li> 
    
    <li><b>HYPEREXTENSION</b></li>
    
    <li><b>FLEXION</b></li>
    
</ol>

<p>The <b>AP</b> view is assess any lateral instability of the spine and also to assess laterolisthesis. When positioning for the AP L-spine, centre the CR to around one inch above the iliac crest. Collimate longitudinally to around 18 inches and do not collimate transversely beyond the ASIS. Radiograph should include the T12-L1, L5-S1, and sacroiliac joints. Visualization of the <b>psoas muscles</b> laterally to L-spine, which arises from L1 and insert to the lesser trochanter indicates optimal exposure. Ideally, the patient's hips and knees should be flexed to decrease L-spine curvature. While a <i>PA L-spine</i> is also possible, it is not recommended because of awkward patient position and increased OID. </p>

<p>The <b>Lateral</b> view is the most useful view clinically because physicians use it to stage spondylolisthesis. Centering point for the Lateral L-spine is same as the AP. Align and stack the patient's hips and shoulders perpendicular to the IR to prevent any anterior or posterior tilt. If correctly positioned, the posterior ribs should demonstrate less than 1/2 of supeimposition with opned intervertebral foramina and intervertebral joint spaces. Acceptable radiograph should include T12-L1 and L5-S1 joints with optimal exposure. Bending the patient's knee can prevent uncomfortable position in a recumbent situation. A piece of Pb strip should also be placed behind the patient's back to reduce scatter.</p>

<p>The <b>Hyperextension &amp; Flexion</b> views are to assess any instability of the spine when bending the vertebral column. Centering is same as the Lateral L-Spine view. However, patients are instructed to bend the L-spine anteriorly and posteriorly from the hip. These positions can be slighly uncomfortable and challenging, the technologist should allow the patient to grab on a stool when bending to prevent a fall. Radiographic assessment is similar to Lateral L-spine but with visualization of L-spine bending.</p> 

<p>Make sure correct radiographic markers and gonadal shieldings are used.</p>

<h3>MAGNETIC RESONANCE</h3>

<p>Spondylolisthesis is often associated with hypertrophic <b>ligamentum flavum</b> and spinal stenosis. Since plain radiographs cannot demonstrate soft tissue, MR is used to visualize such soft tissue structures. Other incidental pathological findings such as <b>disc space cartilage degeneration</b> may also be found in MR.</p>
