<p><i>Do you want to make a difference in a person's life long-term? </i></p>
<p><i>Are you an empathetic person who strives to provide the most excellent care for people? </i></p>
<p><i>Are you a people-oriented person and want a career with great security and fulfillment?</i></p>

<p>If your answers are <b>"yes"</b> to these questions above, a career in health care might be suitable for you. Here me out though, the health care field is vast and career fulfillment can vary across multiple professions. However, the general "prerequisite" of getting into health care certainly is to have a genuine heart for people.</p>

<p>Listen, health care isn't for everyone. As much as being a doctor, a nurse, or any other health care professional is glorified by our society, the disadvantages of working in hospitality services are often overlooked and ignored. </p>

<h3>Never Enter Health Care for the Money</h3>

<p>It is common to have the assumption that "being a doctor would get me so rich." In fact, if you pursue a health care career just for the money, you would quickly find your life miserable because you would be unmotivated to provide personable health care which require a genuine empathetic heart and patience for people. </p>

<p>There are so much more ways to make money outside of health care. Some examples include certain specialities in engineering, investing, and real estate. I repeat, <b>do not</b> enter health care just for the money. You might as well do something else that would provide you the same amount of wealth.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Sickness & Death</h3>

<p>Society often portrays a physician as someone who "sits comfortably in an office talking with normal walking-talking patients." However, this representation is far from being accurate. Yes, there are medical specialties where the societal representation is somewhat true (i.e. Dermatology). <b>BUT</b>, most doctors and health care workers deal with very acute with complex illnesses and even death on a normal basis, which would inevitably produce enormous amount of stress. </p>

<p><i>How would a family physician tell a patient who doesn't speak English that he only has six more months to live because of his stage IV liver cancer?</i></p> 

<p><i>How would a radiologic technologist interact with a palliative patient coming for a chest x-ray?</i></p>

<p><i>How would a nurse comfort the wife of a suddenly deceased husband from a tragic car accident?</i></p>

<p><i>How would a radiologist and an emergency physician coordinate a diagnosis and treatment plan when the patient is rapidly declining due to a stroke?</i></p>

<p>Health care workers have to be trained and experienced to deal with such dire situations effectively. The last thing a patient wants is someone being not personable and rude when they are experiencing the most depressing times of their lives.</p> 

<p>Although being patience, showing empathy, and being relational can be trained (as all health care workers are trained in this regard), if you inherently have trouble relating to other people's circumstances and do not have the mental capacity to deal with complex illnesses and even death, health care would not be a fulfilling career for you.</p> 

<h3>Competitiveness & Continual Education</h3>

<p>Health care education is highly competitive. Medical school has a 5% acceptance rate. Nursing school, dentistry, medical imaging programs, physician assistant programs all require a high level of academic rigour to get in <i>and</i> stay in. You have to study well and show initiative to coming opportunities to not get behind in education. The level of self-discipline required <i>cannot</i> be understated.</p> 

<p>If you hate learning, a career in health care may not appeal to you because your studying do not end just because you have graduated from your program. Almost all regulated health care profession require some form of continual education annually to continue practice their specialty.</p> 

<p>The medical field is continually evolving as new research, technology, and innovation emerges rapidly. For more than a generation, radiographs were the only imaging modality available and standard film-based radiography was considered the final diagnosis imaging method. Now, the emergence of technology has allowed so many imaging methods like digital radiography, CT, MRI, and ultrasound with instantaneous image acquisition to compensate the shortcomings of traditional film-based radiography.</p> 

<p>In the past twenty years with the rapid expansion of information and computers, health care professionals have to keep up with new technology and keep learning new skills to sustain their practice in their field.</p> 

<p>I get it, not everyone loves learning and certainly not everyone in health care enjoys learning. But if you cannot keep up or deal with being a life-long learner, health care is not suitable for you.</p>

<h3>Lack of Flexible Work Schedule & Burn Out</h3>

<p>Yes, there are certain medical specialties where you can work from home with a fixed schedule (i.e. Diagnostic Radiology). But forget about working from home. Forget about having a normal 9-5 working schedule. Forget taking vacation whenever you want.</p> 

<p><b><i>Working in health care in itself is an act sacrifice.</i></b></p>

<p>Unlike a company, a hospital is open 24/7 and it must be staffed to keep it running. You need to be prepared for an irregular work schedule with night shifts, evening shifts, and on calls. Such irregular work schedules can create stress and burn out. In a study by Shanafelt et al, physicians burn out rate is close to 40% because they are neglecting their own health and needs. </p>

<p>It is ironic that sometimes health care workers experience burn out because we are so fixated on fixing and improving health in our patients rather than paying more attention to our own health and needs.</p> 

<p>If you desire a flexible work from home schedule, health care would definitely not fulfill your desires.</p>

<h3>Malpractice can Bring Forth Serious Consequences</h3>

<p>I want to say that I do not want to understate or overlook the consequences of negligence or errors in other important professions like engineering or business, but I don’t think as a society we discuss or explore about the consequences of malpractice in health care.</p> 

<p>Needless to say, health care directly care for vulnerable human lives. It is for this reason even a small error of negligence can have detrimental consequences to the patient and their family. </p>

<p>When you are providing any kind of patient care within the scope of practice of your profession, <i>the life and wellbeing of the patient is fully in your shoulders.</i></p>

<p><b>Let that sink in.</b></p>

<p>You are fully responsible for any harm caused to the patient during your patient care and this statement applies not only to physicians, but to medical imaging professionals, nurses, laboratory technologists, and health care aids. </p>

<p><i>What if you operate on the wrong side of the patient and removed the wrong organ?</i> </p>

<p><i>What if you accidentally administer a drug ten times more than the dose ordered by the physician?</i> </p>

<p><i>What happens when you move the patient for an x-ray but changing the patient’s body position you unknowingly pull a catheter out from his heart?</i> </p>

<p>Not only you might seriously harm or even kill the patient in the above scenarios, you could also jeopardize your medical license through malpractice and lose all rights and privileges to practice within your profession.</p>       

<p>I really recommend thinking through this thoroughly. Do not enter into health care if you think you cannot bear the responsibility.</p>            

<h3>Expensive to Maintain a Career in Health Care</h3>

<p>It is true that some professions in health care can provide you with a solid salary, and if you work in management or accumulate enough seniority, your annual earnings can easily top at six figures.</p> 

<p>But maintaining and sustaining a career in health care is not cheap. We might have all envied at the lucrative salary of a physician. We might have fantasized that working in health care would be an easy road to financial independence. Such assumptions of wealth are often hit hard by the reality of work-related expenses and fees.</p> 

<p>Coming off from the last point of malpractice, health care workers pay a lot of money for <i>professional liability insurance</i> to protect themselves against a lawsuit. On top of that, union fees and tuition for continual education can often eat a good chunk of your already taxed salary.</p> 

<p>Since most health care workers do not work from home, you have to account for auto-insurance, parking fees, commute, and gas to maintain your work. All these little expenses adding up can really pose challenges for your goal of attaining financial independence.</p>

<h3>Please Do Your Research</h3>

<p>Here you go, I’ve listed six points that you have to consider before entering the health care industry so you can make a sounding decision. We shouldn’t just enter health care out of impulse without considering certain drawbacks that might not be well-discussed.</p> 

<p>If you enjoy health care, it can be a very rewarding and fulfilling career. For many people, the thought helping people and making their lives better in their most vulnerable time is what motivates them to be part of this great hospitality industry. Health care is also a very interdisciplinary field where you are encouraged to appreciate and learn from other allied-health workers. </p>

<p>Working in health care doesn't mean you can only become a doctor or a nurse. In fact, if a hospital consists only of doctors and nurses, it simply would not function. This is because the hospital is a very intricate place with highly specialized personnel providing patient care within their profession.</p> 

<p>Some less-known health care professionals include <i>radiologic technologists, sonographers, respiratory therapists, laboratory technologists, </i>and <i>clinical informatics specialists.</i></p>

<p>Choose a speciality within health care that suits your personal interests and ambition. I encourage you research online to explore the huge variety of health care profession available in your area. If you enjoy direct patient care, nursing could be for you. If you enjoy physics and images, a career in medical imaging may intrigue you. If you enjoy chemistry, pharmacy or laboratory sciences may suit you. 

<p>Lastly, really do your research and consider the drawbacks of a health care career before entering it. It is a rewarding and fulfilling career, but it is not for everyone.</p>
