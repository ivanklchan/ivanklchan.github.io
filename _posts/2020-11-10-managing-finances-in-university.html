    <h3>“What Stocks Should I Buy?”</h3>

    <p>As someone who is adequately knowledgeable in personal finances, the most common question I receive from people is: “Ivan, can you tell me what stocks I should buy?”</p>

    <p>Frankly, sometimes I get a little bit frustrated when I hear this question because I believe we should have a good foundational finance knowledge before investing.</p>

    <p>Investing is futile when we are not well financially educated. It is like trying to drive on a highway first without learning how to stop properly at stop signs.</p>

    <p>I am not talking about economical concepts like “supply and demand”, but rather speaking about budgeting and planning our personal finances. Sadly, this is where a lot of people become disinterested and stop their conquest for financial independence.</p>

    <h3>Lack of Financial Education</h3>

    <p>It is astounding how financially uneducated we are. Especially in our consumer culture, it is shocking that our incentives to be at least aware of our financial decisions are painfully low.</p>

    <p>However, I am not surprised because financial education was not taught at school, at least for my generation. It is only until very recently that the Ontario Government decided to include financial literacy as part of the elementary school curriculum.</p>

    <p>So many of us are and will be entering university or college with zero or few financial knowledge, and yet some of us receive large sums of financial aid from our parents or from the government without guidance on how to manage the money.</p>
    <p>This situation leaves many young adults at stake and vulnerable when we enter the workplace after graduation. I think that learning to manage our finances while we still have time for trial and error in university can prevent us from making uninformed and regretful financial decisions later in our lives.</p>

    <h3>Keep Track of Your Expenses</h3>

    <p>I think developing a habit to keep track of our expenses is the forefront of becoming financially literate because just visualizing our spending provides us with awareness of certain spending trends.</p>

    <p>I use Mint to keep track of my credit and debit card expenses and I review my spending records every week. It is actually quite an easy habit to do. Every week and every month I tally my total spending and to pinpoint any miscellaneous pointless expenses I made. From that, I write a little weekly or monthly summary on how I could have improved to avoid the same spending mistakes.</p>

    <p>Mint is just a tool I use because it automatically tracks my credit and debit card transactions. You can also use Google Keep or any notes app you prefer to manually keep track of your spending. Just make sure to document any cash transactions as they can easily be missed.</p>

    <p>I’ve seen huge improvements in my spending habits after I started tracking my spending. I became more financially conservative and more aware of my spending before I make any purchases.</p>

    <p>The image below illustrates an example:</p>


    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/expenses-tracking-pic.jpg">

    <p>I always remind myself that spending $5 isn’t much. But if I spend $5 everyday, that would account for $150 extra expenses each month. Always remember that small pointless expenses add up!</p>

    <h>Save Up Your Money</h4>

    <p>Chances are some of us have some sort of part time income during university. Instead of spending nearly all your hard-earned dollars on a shopping spree, I suggest saving up at least 10 to 15% of your earnings each month.</p>

    <p>Despite 10 to 15% might not seem much, especially to those people earning minimum wage. But developing this habit of saving yourself money first when the paycheque arrives will allow us to be more financially aware and fiscally conservative in the future.</p>

    <h3>Invest Your Money</h3>

    <p>Once you have good finance foundation knowledge, it is time to invest your money. Again, I can’t stress more the importance of having enough financial knowledge before investing because without such knowledge it is like learning to run before walking.</p>

    <p>It’s tempting to believe that leaving cash in a bank account is the best way to “save” money. However, time will prove this concept wrong because of inflation. The same $100 today is not the same $100 ten years ago because we realize the prices of goods and services increase over time.</p>

    <p>Keeping money in a bank account will only slowly depreciate the value of the money.</p>

    <p>Many of us overlook taxes as an expense without realizing a quarter of our salary goes to the government. Another way to look at this is that we work three months out of a year to keep nothing for ourselves.</p>

    <p>Any investment we do should have a return high enough to cover up inflation and taxes expenses.</p>

    <p>There are many types of investments out there - stocks, securities, mutual funds, ETFs, precious metals, real estate, and many more. This goes back to the question that many of my peers ask me:</p>

    <h3>What stocks should I buy?</h4>

    <p>I refrain from giving any specific stock recommendations because I don’t want to be liable for my peers’ financial loss. It is also tricky to answer this question because everyone has different financial situations and risk tolerances. One investment may suit a person well but could be detrimental to another person’s financial health.</p>

    <p>What I suggest is to figure out your own personal financial needs and research on investments that fits your personal needs. Ask yourself questions such as ”What are my goals”, “What am I passionate about?”, “What are my risk tolerances?”. Ask a qualified financial professional for help. I am confident that you can find a finance professional just by asking your family and your friends.</p>

    <p>Remember that no one is responsible for your money other than yourself!</p>

    <h3>Keep Learning</h3>

    <p>The world of personal finance is vast. We need to be informed and consistently learn through experiences to be competent in our future financial decisions.</p>

    <p>Many people I know refuse to start investing because they fear losing money. And I understand the fear. In fact, no one would want their hard earned dollars vanish overnight in the stock market.</p>

    <p>This is why being financially educated and informed is the cornerstone of achieving financial independence at a young age. We will be able to manage our finances and invest wisely. We will inevitably incur some loss when we invest and that is ok because we all learn from our mistakes.</p>

    <p>No one can predict the future and no investment is guaranteed to make us rich. We cannot control the stock market but we can control our own finances by being financially educated when we are still in university.</p>
