    <h3 id="preplacement">PREPLACEMENT</h3>
    
    <p>Preplacement occurs at Winter Term before clinical commences in May. Make sure you pass all 2nd Year MEDRADSC courses (except for MEDRADSC 2BB3). Mohawk College will discuss preplacement with you discusses in the Winter Term, so you will get familiar with the process by then. Try to get the paperwork and immunization records done ASAP because they can pile up. </p>
    
    <p>To get yourself ready for Clinical, remember to review all your courses (especially skills) because all the theory you have learned will be applied right away!! I suggest buying two pairs of scrubs! Wear comfortable running shoes in Clinical because you will be walking a lot. On the day before Clinical, <b>sleep well</b> and I’d advise dress a little formal on your first day :)</p>

    <h3 id="firstTwoWeeks">ORIENTATION</h3>
    
    <p>The first two weeks in clinical are <b>orientation.</b> Use these two weeks to get familiar with the workflow and the hospital in these two weeks.</p>

    <p>On the first day, you will meet your <b>Clinical Education Leader (CEL)</b>. Your CEL will take you on a tour around the hospital and you will receive security badges which grant you clearance to selected areas in the hospital. Your CEL will introduce you to the Diagnostic Imaging Department in your hospital, he or she will also be helping, guiding, evaluating your <b>Skills Assessments</b>, and assessing your <b>Case Reviews</b> throughout Clinical.</p>

    <p>Within the first two weeks, you will be taught to use the PACS system in your hospital. In school, Ultrasound students use PACS systems but Radiography students do not, If you are in Radiography, you may need a little more time to get familiar with PACS in your site.</p>

    <p>My first two weeks in Hamilton General Hospital was pretty draining. I had no experience in healthcare, so I was pretty overwhelmed by the amount of workload in the X-ray Department. I remember vividly on the first day that I was “left alone” in the X-ray Department because everyone went to do a case right away. So I had to actively seek out tasks to do.</p>

    <p>I was assigned to General Radiography (Gen Rad) in my first week, it is the area where outpatients, inpatients, and emergency patients come to have their X-ray done.</p>
    
    <p>The most challenging part in my first week was to recall skills on the spot and think critically depending on the patient without being nervous. I spent most of the time in my first week observing Technologists, which was fine considering CP1 students have little to no experience in the hospital. However, please actively show initiative and be hands-on with the procedure right away :). The earlier you get over the fear of talking to real patients, the faster</b> you will improve your skills.</p>
    
    <p>My second week of Clinical was in Emergency Radiography (ER), this was my "Evening Shift". I will discuss ER more later :)</p>
    
    <h3 id="clinicalRotations">CLINICAL ROTATIONS &amp; EXPERIENCES</h3>
    
    <p><b>Clinical Rotations</b> are different areas within your specializations. I will explain Clinical Rotations of Radiography in detail and my friends will talk about their experiences in Ultrasound and Radiation Therapy.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center";>_______________________________________________</p>
    
    <h3 id="radiographyCR"><b>Radiography</b></h3>
    
    <p>In <b>Radiography</b>, Clinical Rotations are different work areas you will be placed in during Clinical. Here are the Clinical Rotations in Radiography CP1: </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>General Radiography (Gen Rad)</b></li>
        
        <p>Patients in Gen Rad present with various conditions ranging from walking-talking patients to totally sedated while accompanied by a nurse. I had to perform a variety of x-ray exams encompassing almost all the views I learned from Skills. Teamwork and communication skills are important in Gen Rad because often I had workwith a team of Technologists and nurses on more complex patients.</p>
        
        <li><b>Emergency Radiology (ER)</b></li>
        
        <p>Patients in ER usually takes first priority. Sometimes you may be required to perform an X-ray portably in the trauma suite because they might just arrived to the hospital from a car accident. Depending on the situation, there could be an ocean of people such as physicians, nurses, anaesthesiologists, and technologists in the room, I had perform the X-ray procedure swiftly because being slow can put the patient's life in danger. My experience in ER improved my communciations skills a lot.</p>
        
        <li><b>Fracture Clinic (FC)</b></li>
        
        <p>I think the FC has the most resemblence to Skills Courses<. Since I perform x-ray exams just as how you practiced in Skills Labs, I tried my best to improve my communication skills and positioning skills in the FC. Sometimes, perfect images are not possible due to patient's condition. While I was in the FC, I learned how to assess the patient and tweak ,y technique to produce the best images I could obtain.</p>
        
        <p>Since I could be working independently with minimal supervision in FC, this provides an excellent opportunity to practice my critical thinking skills.</p>
        
        <p>Fracture clinics can get busy, I tried to improve my workflow in FC.</p>

        <li><b>Operating Room (OR)</b></li>
        
        <p>I was taught to use fluoroscopic equipment to perform basic fluoroscopic procedures in the OR from scratch. Do not worry about "messing up" at the beginning because Technologists assume you don't know anything about fluoroscopy.</p>
        
        <p>In the OR, my supervising Technologist and I had to enforce radiation safety protocols like wearing lead aprons.</p>
        
        <li><b>Portable Radiography (PORT)</b></li>

        <p>Like fluoroscopy, this is a skill that I had to learn from scratch. It was a bit difficult to me to go through portables because there was a lot more detail and communication I had to do. Patients are watched by nurses, it's important to let them know what I was doing.</p>

        <p>I think the most important skills is communication because I had to make sure the nurse knows what I am doing. Patients often have many lines and tubes connected and quite frankly, I don't know what all those lines and tubes do. It's nice to ask the nurse what those lines and tubes are because misplacing them could place a patient in danger.</p>

        <p>Overall, I liked portables because I corrected many mistakes of ineffective communication. When you see the improvements yourself, gently pat your back :), for you have achieved great things.</p>

        <li><b>Interventional Radiology (IR)</b></li>

        <p> CP1 doesn't really touch a lot on IR. But if you do get a chance to get some exposure to it, I suggest take the opportunity.</p>

        <p> I had the chance to observe several simple IR procedures in an afternoon.</p>

        <p> However, I haven't took any coureses on interventional procedures, so I cannot speak of my experience. But I believe CP2 and CP3 will have interventional procedures and I absolutely look forward to those.</p>
        
        <li><b>Computed Tomography (CT)</b></li>
        
        <p>CT was new territory for me as a CP1 student, simply because Level II students had no prior exposure to it. Technologists also assumed I had no prior CT knowledge so I wasn't worrying too much. Much of my first day in CT was spent observing and asking questions from time to time. Technologists may let you get a little hands-on on a CT head protocol because it is the most simple CT protocol.</p>
        
        <p>Of course, there will be more complex CT procedures when trauma patients come in. Just observe and show initiative patient care such as transfers are needed.</p>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Make sure to review the following concepts before CP1. </b></p>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>kVp, mAs, and concept of AEC</li>
        
        <li>Body habitus</li>
        
        <li>Anatomical landmarks</li>
        
        <li>Positioning, centering, and FOV</li>
        
        <li>Lead marker placements</li>
        
        <li>Basic radiation protection</li>
        
        <li>Assess radiographs for positioning, pathology, and artifacts</li>
        
    </ul>
        
    <p>We are not Radiologists, but we still need to recognize some basic image patterns for some common pathologies such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and fractures.</p>
    
    <p>Above all else, if you ask questions, show initiaive, communicate well, and form good relationships with Technologists and your CEL, they will really appreciate you being there!</p>

    <h3 id="ultrasoundCR"><b>Ultrasound</b></h3>
    
    <p>Special thanks to <b>Sydney Ung</b> and her friend for sharing their Clinical experiences in <b>Ultrasound!</b></p>
    
    <p>Clinical Rotations in Ultraound are <b>Abdomen, Obstetrics,</b> and <b>Gynaecology.</b> Although the focus of CP1 Ultrasound is Abdomen, you can be performing all three sonographic procedures as mentioned previously in CP1. You may also observe or participate in muscoloskeletal (MSK), vascular, transvaginal, transrectal, andscrotal ultrasound.</p>
    
    <ul> 
        
        <li><b>Abdomen</b></li>
        
        <p>Abdomen refers to an abdominal ultrasound where you scan abdomen and mainly assess the aorta, inferior vena cava, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, common bile duct, kidneys, and spleen. Depending on your clinical site, they may make you scan the bladder and right and left lower quadrants as well. Depending on the patient’s clinical presentation, you can be scanning for stones, space occupying lesions, any abnormal appearances of the organs, dilated vessels or ducts, etc.</p>
        
        <li><b>Obstetrics (OB)</b></li>
        
        <p><b>Obstetrical ultrasounds</b> is when technologists scan pregnant women. These scans can just be following up at-risk pregnancies like if the baby has a growth restriction, or can be anatomical scan where many measurements are taken to find an accurate due date for the mom. There are also Biophysical Profile (BPP) scans that just assess the movement of the baby to see if it is doing well.</p>
            
        <li><b>Gynaecology (Gyn)</b></li>
        
        <p><b>Gynaecology scans</b> are for assessing the reproductive organs of a female patient</b>, whether it is due to pain, irregular menses, ovarian cysts, etc.</p>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>In regards to the “Clinical Rotations”</b>, depending on the layout of the hospital, you may be scanning <b>in-patients</b> (patients that stay in the hospital) along with <b>emergency patients</b> all day or may be scanning <b>out-patients</b> (patients that just drop by for a routine follow up scan) all day. Or you could scan all three types of patients each day. But as mentioned, the tech will always be scanning all types of ultrasounds; abdomen, OB, and gyn!</p>
    
    <p>Abdominal ultrasound can be a <b>complex procedure</b> for new sonography students. There's so many organs to go through, along with the many images that need to be taken and varying difficulty in visualization. Since there are so many organs you need to look at, you'll get a lot of different cases/pathologies that you need to know how to scan appropriately.</p>
    
    <p>As you work at your placement, ou will feel discouraged as you may not be able to spot any pathologies or abnormalities, or will take way too long performing one abdominal scan. Throughout the whole placement it’s important to remember that this is just the beginning and that there is so much room and time for improvement. While you are there, as long as you <b>try your best, keep a positive mindset</b>, and make the most of the experience by forming good relationships with your CEL and other technologists, you will be able to <b>grow and improve.</b></p>
    
    <p>For CP1, one of the best ways to prepare for clinical would be to <b>review all the normal measurements of the abdominal organs and to review the techniques of scanning the abdomen.</b> Technologists or your CEL may ask you questions about normal limits or if “this organ is within the normal range limit.”</p>
    
    <p>The technologists do not expect much from you as a CP1 student. They understand that this is your first placement and that you just came fresh out of school with no hands on skills of scanning in the “real world”. However, as it is your CP1, <b>you are expected to be able to perform abdominal scans</b>, even though you may take a long time or have many struggles. As I mentioned, if you have a general understanding of the normal measurements of organs, and a general understanding of common pathologies seen within the abdomen, you will be okay! </p>
        
    <p>As long as you are motivated and willing to <b>take risks, ask questions, and learn</b>, they will really appreciate you as a student.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center";>_______________________________________________</p>
    
    <h3 id="radTherapyCR">Radiation Therapy (RT)</h3>
    
    <p>Since Radiation Therapy is suspended for my year, I reached out to Upper Year Radiation Therapy students for help. Nevertheless, their experiences are invaluable and helpful for those of you in Radiation Therapy!!</p> 
    
    <p><b>Caitlyn Wilcken</b> is currently a Fourth Year Radiation Therapy student. Many thanks to her  for sharing her Radiation Therapy CP1 experience!</p>
    
    <p>Before you start Clinical as a RT CP1 student, it's expected of you to understand how to set up for each type of cancer. It is also expected that you have some oncology knowledge about each type of cancer and basic aatomy in order to do image matching. You are expected to understand radiation protection and physics.</p> 
    
    <p>To prepare yourself for Clinical, you need to feel confident in your set-ups, making sure to practice in the lab! Also, knowing your information on each cancer is important - understanding causes, demographics, location of cancer, and how common the cancer is. All those things listed are basic knowledge and make sure you know your anatomy as well!</p>
    
    <p>During Clinical, you will work alongside with another Radiation Therapist in performing set ups and being able to engage in conversation with pateints.</p>
    
    <p>About the structure of RT CP1, you are required to complete three skills assessments: <b>thorax or breast set up, pelvis set up, and head/neck set up.</b> You  will rotate through different units epending on your Clinical Site: CT Simulation, brachytherapy, and treatment planning.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center";>_______________________________________________</p>
    
    <!-- <h3 id="importantTakeaways">IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS</h3>
    
    <p>Below I listed what I think are some important takeways that I treasured the most during my time in CP1.</p>
    
    <ol>
        
        <li><b>Patient Care</b>

            <p><b>The ability to give patient care and be skilled at it is important</b> regardless of your specialization. This means that you <b>ARE EXPECTED</b> to perform or assist in patient care procedures that are <b>WITHIN</b> your scope of practice.</p>
            
            <div class="webLinks">
            <p>With that being said, <b>DO NOT</b> undermine the importance of <b>MEDRADSC 2A03 Patient Care</b>, a mandatory course taught in Winter Term of 2nd Year. This course teaches you basic nursing skills that are within the Medical Radiation Technologist's scope of practice. These nursing skills you are allowed to perform are listed in the <b>Competency Profiles</b> in <b><a href="https://www.camrt.ca/certification-3/current-competency-profiles/" target="_blank">Canadian Assiociation of Medical Radiation Technologists</a></b> and <b><a href="https://sonographycanada.ca/" target="_blank">Sonography Canada</a>.</b></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>I thought <b><i>"I am not a nurse, why do I need to know these skills? This course is so useless and extra"</i>.</b> </p>
            
            <p><b>I was wrong.</b></p>
                
            <p>Here are some patient care skills that are important for <b>Radiography</b> and <b>Ultrasound:</b></p> 
            
            <ul>
                
                <li><b>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</b></li>
                
                <p>This is one of the <b>most basic skill</b> that a student is expected to know. You need to know the correct steps of <b>putting on</b> and <b>removing</b> personal protective equipment and be confident in this skill. This is because patients in the hospital can carry <b>contagious diseases</b> and need to be <b>isolated.</b></p>
                
                <p>Being in a procedure that requires personal protective equipment can seem daunting at first. Don't worry, the Technologist is there to guide you and you will get used to the skill soon.</p>
                    
                <li><b>Patient Transfer</b></li>
                
                <p>With more <b>complex patients</b> such as patients on a stretcher or a wheeler, you need to <b>transfer the patient</b> before starting your procedure. You need to have <b>good body ergonomics</b> when transfering patients because you don't want to <b>hurt yourself AND the patient.</b></p>
                
                <p>This skill is <b>EXTREMELY</b> important in Radiography because you are expected to assist Technologists in transfering a patient from stretcher to the X-ray table. For Ultrasound, you need to know how to transfer patients from a wheelchair to the bed before scanning.</p>
                
                <li><b>Sterile Procedure</b></li>
                
                <p><b>Sterile procedure</b> refers the use of sterile equipment: equipment without any bacterial or viral contamination, on a patient.</p>
                
                <p>In <b>Ultrasound</b>, you may be required to set up a sterile field for an <b>ultrasound guided biopsy.</b> Make sure you are confident in this skill.</p>
                
                <p>For <b>Radiography</b>, you probably won't set up a sterile field in CP1. <b>HOWEVER</b>, you need to be aware of sterile fields in the <b>Operating Room (OR).</b></p>
                
                <li><b>Urinal and Bedpans</b></li>
                
                <p><b>Urinals</b> are used to collect <b>liquid wastes (urine)</b> and <b>bedpans</b> are used to collect <b>solid wastes (feces).</b>
                
                <p>While the occurance is rare, <b>patients may need to urinate or defecate during your procedure.</b> You need to know how to respond, fetch the right equipment, and correctly dispose bodily waste.</p> 
                
                <li><b>Monitoring Vital Signs &amp; CPR</b></li>
                
                <p><b>Blood pressure, heart rate</b>, and <b>oxygen saturation level</b> values are important. This is because these values give you information about a patient's <b>vital signs</b>, being familiar with critical values that signal a patient is in <b>distress</b> and then take appropriate actions <b>WILL SAVE LIVES.</b></p> 
                
                <p>If a patient has a cardiac arrest during your procedure, you are <b>REQUIRED</b> to perform CPR <b>RIGHT AWAY</b> before the critical care response team of your hospital arrives at your location.</p> 
                
                <li><b>Oxygen Administration</b></li>
                
                <p>Sometimes you may need to get a patient on oxygen therapy. You need to know how to correctly unplug the oxygen tubing from a wall-mounted oxygen source to an oxygen tank. <b>Remember</b> that oxygen is a medication and can ONLY be prescribed by a Physician.</p>
                
            </ul>
            
            <p>I can't stress this more: <b>TAKE MEDRADSC 2A03 PATIENT CARE SERIOUSLY!</b>
            
        <li><b>Self Confidence</b></li>
        
        <p>This is an issue I am still struggling but has been improving since Clinical.</p>
        
        <p><b>You probably will feel discouraged in Clinical</b> because it is your first time working in the hospital. <b>Below are a few examples of negative comments I have gave myself:</b></p>
        
        <ul>
            
            <li><i>"The Technologists probably think I am stupid becuase I made a HUGE mistake."</i></li>
            
            <li><i>"I am practically the WORST student because I think everyone else is performing better than me."</i></li>
            
            <li><i>"This Technologist called me out and probably would give me a bad Weekly Evaluation today."</i></li>
            
            <li><i>"OK so this Technologist actually gave me a bad Weekly Evaluation, I am going to cry tonight RIP."</i></li>
            
            <li><i>"I just got a Learning Contract, I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO FAIL!"</i></li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <p>As you can see, each subsequent negative comment is <i><b>worse</b></i> than the previous one. Not only these comments I made to myself <b>harmful to my well-being</b>, it also made me <b>spiral down a staircase of low-confidence, anxiety, and depression.</b></p>
        
        <p>Think about this, <b>EVERYONE WILL BE</b> struggling in some way during Clinical. Undoubtly <b>EVERYONE WILL</b> in some way feel discouraged.</p>
        
        <p>So, to prevent yourself spiralling down emotionally and physically endlessly, <b>try the following:</b></p>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li><b>ASK</b> yourself questions: "What could I have done better in the situation?"</li>
            
            <li><b>WRITE DOWN</b> steps you can take to improve next time.</li>
            
            <li><b>PRACTICE</b> in front of a mirror if you struggle in patient communication.</li>
            
            <li><b>READ the POSITIVE comments</b> that your CEL/Technologists gave you, they are <b>HUGE</b> confidence boosters.</li>
            
            <li><b>DO NOT</b> hide your struggles and your anxiety, openly talk to your CEL and the Technologists about your issues. Many Technologists ARE HAPPY to help you and guide you to the right direction.</li> 
            
            <li><b>FACE your challenges</b>, avoiding them would only get matters worse and halt your learning.</li>
            
            <li><b>REMEMBER you are bound to make mistakes as a student.</b> How can you really learn if you do not make mistakes?</li>
            
        </ul>
            
        <p>Keep in mind that you are there to learn. While you can observe other students on how they perform a procedure, <b>DO NOT compare yourself to other students because this would only make Clinical dreadful for you</b>. Everyone has different learning styles and will learn differently. Everyone approaches to the same situation differently, a method that works for you may not work for others.</p>
            
        <li><b>Communication</b></li>
        
        <p>Effective communication between you and your team is crucial to facilicate effeciency and to prevent conflict in the workplace.</p>
        
        <p>My nervousness shows when I get intimidated and when I feel confronted, I tend to tense up, back-away, and be quiet. There had been several misunderstanding between the me and the Technologist because I did not speak up when I felt anxious. Consequently, <b>productivity and efficiency plummetted.</b></p>
        
        <p>You might feel intimidated and confronted in Clinical because of you are scared, anxious, and nervous.</p>
        
        <p><b>Try not to let your nervousness and anxiousness hinder your communication.</b> I understand it is easier to say than to do it, but <b>here are some tips I used:</b></p>
        
        <ul>
            
            <li><b>When in doubt, ASK!</b></li> 
                
            <p>Ask the Technologist when you are in doubt of something. Do not try to resolve tasks you are unsure of because it <b>WILL</b> lead to misunderstanding.</p>
            
            <li><b>ALWAYS tell the Technologist what you are doing.</b></li>
            
            <p>Tell the Technologist what you are doing during the procedure so they know what other tasks they can do. This will <b>improve workflow</b> by a thousand fold.</p>
                
            <li><b>Do not keep "secrets" from Technologists</b></li>
            
            <p>This is totally <b>unprofessional</b> and would only make you a <b>bad impression.</b> When you keep "secrets", it shows to the Technologists that you are an <b>ineffective communicator.</b></p>
            
            <li><b>AlWALYS ask what you CAN be doing.</b></li>
            
            <p>It shows <b>great initiative</b> when you always ask what you can do and how you can help. Sometimes the Technologist might say "No" because they already have enough bodies. When this happens, think about <b>what ELSE you can be doing.</b> You could be cleaning, logging your cases, finishing up paperwork, or doing your Case Review.</p>
            
        </ul>
        
        <p>It makes a noticeable difference when you communicate effectively because it makes you <b>an emoployable individual.</b></p>
        
        <li><b>Networking</b></li>
        
        <p>The Hospital provides you <b>excellent opportunities to network.</b> Don't treat CPI Clinical Site as a place you just "come and go". <b>Rather,</b> treat CPI just as if you <b>belong to the Hospital</b>. During Clinical, try your best to form good relationships with the Technologist and the Physicians. There is always a higher chance of employment when they remember you more positively.</p>
        
        <p>It doesn't take much effort to network and certainly it is not "scary". Something as simple as saying <b>"Hello!"</b> to a Technologist will make them remember you! If you struggle with a Case Review, do not hesitate to ask a <b>Radiologist</b> or a <b>Radiology Resident!</b> They can provide <b>invaluable knowledge</b> and <b>resources</b> for you. <b>USE THIS OPPORTUNITY</b> to network with Physicians!</p> 
        
        <p>Finally, <b>DO NOT</b> have a mindset of <i>"I won't apply to my CP1 Hospital in the future because I am only there for three months."</i>. <b>YOU NEVER KNOW!! This is why networking and maintaining good relationships are so important in Clinical!!!</b></p>

    <p>This Clinical was probably one of my most intense experience because of the workload and stress. I had around six hours or less of sleep each night for three months, and it reminded me an excerpt from the Medical Radiation Sciences program website:</p> 
    
    <blockquote><b>"The Medical Radiation Science health professions are physically and emotionally demanding because they routinely involve interaction with patients. Since applicants will work in these professions, it is important that they become familiar with any functional demands before entering the program to ensure that they can perform at an acceptable standard for employment."</b></blockquote>
    
    <p>When I read that in Grade 12, I thought to myself: "<i>lol I'll be fine hahaha</i>".</p>
    
    <p>And indeed, I am fine...<i>ish</i>. Well, at least I know that because I am coughing and sneezing as I write this blog. In reality, working endlessly while keeping up with my own responsibilties had took a slight toll on my health. I was physically drained and sick towards the end of Clinical. It wasn't just me, everyone in the program was sleep deprived. Initially, I thought Clinical was similar to a typical office job from 8 to 4, just with some X-ray or ultrasound stuff. You know, what could possibly go wrong?</p>
    
    <p>I wonder if anyone else read the same excerpt above when they were in Grade 12.</p> 
    
    <p>It was a bittersweet experience.</p> 
    
    <p>It was bitter because Clinical completely torn my schedule apart. There is no <i>"Oh I will sleep in and ask my friends for notes after zzz..."</i>. I had to physically kick my own ass out of my bed at 6:15 AM while regretting why my dumbass slept at 1:00 AM.</p> 
    
    <p><i>But it was sweet</i> because I learned to manage my time and use my time effectively. I became much more  aware of procrastination and improved my productivity.</p>
    
    <p>It was bitter because Clinical forced me to sacrifice many activities I do as a hobby. I played less games, I read less books, I listened to less music, and I had less free time to myself. I kept thinking: <i>"is this going to be the rest of my life until I retire?"</i></p>
    
    <p><i>But it was sweet</i> because I spent time reflecting and spent time on planning my future.</p>
    
    <p>It was bitter because sometimes I just had to suck up my mistakes and openly aditting them in front of everyone.</p>
    
    <p><i>But it was sweet</i> because through openly accepting my mistakes and criticisms, I became competent in my skills and I imrpoved my self-confidence.</p>
    
    <p>It was bitter because I had to leave all the amazing Technologists and my CEL suddenly.</p> 
    
    <p><i>But it was sweet</i> because I learned so many valuable lessons from them. I have became more aware of my language and I see huge improvements in my communication skills.</p>
    
    <p>On my last day in CP1, I sobbed as I walk out of Hamilton General Hospital. It was a huge relief on my heart too because I could not believe I just finished Clinical Practicum. I waited for my bus in front of Hamilton General Hospital for the last time as a Radiography Student.</p>
    
    <p>I got onto the bus and a thought sparked in my mind:</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center";><b><i>"I should write a blog about my Clinical."</i></b></p>
